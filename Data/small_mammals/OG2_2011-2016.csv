Uppers greyish brown, speckled orange at the flanks. Unders white. Tail all dark with small tuft at end. Had stripe of dark fur on top of pes and manus. Not spiny anywhere (think too young). DTT classification is based on colouration, overall jizz (similar to what I think was a baby DTT in OG2-N last week), all dark tail, tuft at end of tail and dark fur on top of feet. Although worth noting that I haven't caught any other DTTs on this grid this week. Have photos if you'd like to cast your expert eye over them, and on comparing the photos to those taken of what I think was a juvey DTT in OG2-N, they do look very similar (of course I could have got the ID of both wrong!). Didn't take a fur sample as far too tiny. I classed as F? Because despite being tiny there seemed to be a bare patch just under the nubbin that looks like what you would normally expect for an unperforated female. Escaped at base camp after processing – not sure how this happened as she was safely back in the trap, door closed, job done – but on the plus side she did trundle off in vaguely the right direction to get home. Best of luck in life dearie, hope you're in the recaps in years to come! EDIT by ORW: Changed to F from F?",
