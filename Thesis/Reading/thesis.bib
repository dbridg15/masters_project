abstract = {We lack sufficient understanding of the processes by which biodiversity alterations induced by land cover change impact ecosystem functioning. An understanding of the mechanistic role of biodiversity is required to provide a functional perspective on ecosystem service delivery. To bridge this gap, investigating complementarity and heterogeneity in functional traits within species groups or across trophic levels is particularly relevant. Such an understanding will then facilitate spatial mapping of areas of co-occurrence of multiple ecosystem services, as well as of critical trade-offs between monetized, cultural and other supporting ecosystem services that need to be considered as hard constraints to ecosystem management. In doing so, the nature and underpinnings of tradeoffs between bundles of ecosystem services accruing to different regions and groups of people, impacting equity and wellbeing, will be uncovered to support improved policy and land planning. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Ecology and geomorphology recognize the dynamic aspects of resistance and resilience. However, formal resilience theory in ecology has tended to deemphasize the geomorphic habitat template. Conversely, landscape sensitivity and state-and-transition models in geomorphology downweight mechanisms of biotic adaptation operative in fluctuating, spatially explicit environments. Adding to the interdisciplinary challenge of understanding complex biogeomorphic systems is that environmental heterogeneity and overlapping gradients of disturbance complicate inference of the geographic patterns of resistance and resilience. We develop a conceptual model for comparing the resilience properties among barrier dunes. The model illustrates how adaptive cycles and panarchies, the formal building blocks of resilience recognized in ecology, can be expressed as a set of hierarchically nested geomorphic and ecological metrics. The variance structure of these data is proposed as a means to delineate different kinds and levels of resilience. Specifically, it is the dimensionality of these data and how geomorphic and ecological variables load on the first and succeeding axes that facilitates the delineation of resistance and resilience. The construction of dune topographic state space from observations among different barrier islands is proposed as a way to measure the interdependence of geomorphic and ecological resilience properties.},

abstract = {Increasing frequency of extreme climate events is likely to impose increased stress on ecosystems and to jeopardize the services that ecosystems provide. Therefore, it is of major importance to assess the effects of extreme climate events on the temporal stability (i.e., the resistance, the resilience, and the variance) of ecosystem properties. Most time series of ecosystem properties are, however, affected by varying data characteristics, uncertainties, and noise, which complicate the comparison of ecosystem stability metrics (ESMs) between locations. Therefore, there is a strong need for a more comprehensive understanding regarding the reliability of stability metrics and how they can be used to compare ecosystem stability globally. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of temporal ESMs based on time series of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index of 15 global land-cover types. We provide a framework (i) to assess the reliability of ESMs in function of data characteristics, uncertainties and noise and (ii) to integrate reliability estimates in future global ecosystem stability studies against climate disturbances. The performance of our framework was tested through (i) a global ecosystem comparison and (ii) an comparison of ecosystem stability in response to the 2003 drought. The results show the influence of data quality on the accuracy of ecosystem stability. White noise, biased noise, and trends have a stronger effect on the accuracy of stability metrics than the length of the time series, temporal resolution, or amount of missing values. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of integrating reliability estimates to interpret stability metrics within confidence limits. Based on these confidence limits, other studies dealing with specific ecosystem types or locations can be put into context, and a more reliable assessment of ecosystem stability against environmental disturbances can be obtained.},

abstract = {Species diversity is thought to stabilize functioning of plant communities. An alternative view is that stability depends more on dynamics of dominant species than on diversity. We compared inter-annual variability (inverse of stability) of aboveground biomass in paired restored and remnant tallgrass prairies at two locations in central Texas, USA. Data from these two locations were used to test the hypothesis that greater richness and evenness in remnant than restored prairies would reduce variability in aboveground biomass in response to natural variation in rainfall. Restored prairies were chosen to be similar to paired remnant prairies in characteristics other than species diversity that affect temporal variability in biomass. Variability was measured as the coefficient of variation among years (square root of variance/mean; CV), where variance in community biomass equals the sum of variances of individual plant species plus the summed covariances between species pairs. Species diversity over five years was greater by a factor of 2 or more in remnant than restored prairies because richness and evenness were greater in remnant than restored prairies. Still, the CV of community biomass during spring and CV of annual biomass production did not differ consistently between prairie types. Neither the sum of species covariances nor total community biomass differed between prairies. Biomass varied relatively little in restored compared to remnant prairies because biomass of the dominant species in restored prairies (the grass Schizachyrium scoparium) varied less than did biomass of other dominant and sub-dominant species. In these grasslands, biomass response to natural variation in precipitation depended as much on characteristics of a dominant grass as on differences in diversity.},

abstract = {Theory predicts a positive relationship between biodiversity and stability in ecosystem properties, while diversity is expected to have a negative impact on stability at the species level. We used virtual experiments based on a dynamic simulation model to test for the diversity-stability relationship and its underlying mechanisms in Central European forests. First our results show that variability in productivity between stands differing in species composition decreases as species richness and functional diversity increase. Second we show temporal stability increases with increasing diversity due to compensatory dynamics across species, supporting the biodiversity insurance hypothesis. We demonstrate that this pattern is mainly driven by the asynchrony of species responses to small disturbances rather than to environmental fluctuations, and is only weakly affected by the net biodiversity effect on productivity. Furthermore, our results suggest that compensatory dynamics between species may enhance ecosystem stability through an optimisation of canopy occupancy by coexisting species.},

abstract = {1 Freshwater fish are a vital resource for local communities across the rural tropics. In Southeast Asia, 2 biodiversity-rich forests are being logged and converted to extensive oil-palm monocultures. This 3 clearly impacts associated freshwater ecosystems, but the impact on their biodiversity remains 4 largely understudied and poorly understood, despite the important provisioning service that 5 freshwater fishes provide for human well-being. This study quantifies the biomass stocks of 6 freshwater fish across a land use gradient encompassing primary forest, twice-logged forest and oil 7 palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysia, in an area where local communities are known to harvest 8 freshwater fish. Stream fish were sampled using a cast net, the dominant technique used by local 9 fishermen, in 200 m long transects in 16 streams over three sampling years (2011, 2013 and 2015). 10 Unexpectedly, no impact of land use on total fish availability was detected. There were no significant 11 differences in fish species richness, or most importantly, biomass per unit fishing effort across the 12 land use gradient. There was variation in the responses of five known food species (Tor tambra, 13 Hampala sabana, Barbodes sealei, Barbonymus balleroides and Gastromyzon lepidogaster), and 14 these small differences are attributed to variation in species habitat selection that co-vary with land 15 use change. Despite evidence to suggest freshwater fish communities are resilient to land use 16 change, they still face risks associated with disturbance such as invasion by alien species; 17 furthermore, several of the more stenotopic species were only present in primary forest catchments. 18 Nonetheless, freshwater fish in small headwater streams appear to represent a sustainable food 19 resource for villages established in human-modified forests or developed oil palm plantations. 20 21},

abstract = {Tropical Southeast Asia harbors extraordinary species richness and in its entirety comprises four of the Earth's 34 biodiversity hotspots. Here, we examine the assembly of the Southeast Asian biota through time and space. We conduct meta-analyses of geological, climatic and biological (including 61 phylogenetic) datasets to test which areas have been the sources of long-term biological diversity in SE Asia, particularly in the pre-Miocene, Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene, and whether the respective biota have been dominated by in situ diversification, immigration and/or emigration, or equilibrium dynamics. We identify Borneo and Indochina, in particular, as major  evolutionary hotspots' for a diverse range of fauna and flora. While most of the region's biodiversity is a result of both the accumulation of immigrants and in situ diversification, within-area diversification and subsequent emigration have been the predominant signals characterizing Indochina and Borneo's biota since at least the early Miocene. In contrast, colonization events are comparatively rare from younger volcanically active emergent islands such as Java, which show increased levels of immigration events. Few dispersal events were observed across the major biogeographic barrier of Wallace's Line. Accelerated efforts to conserve Borneo's flora and fauna in particular, currently housing the highest levels of Southeast Asian plant and mammal species richness, are critically required.},

abstract = {The relationship between species diversity and functional diversity is a fundamental topic in conservation ecology but its direct evaluation in naturally heterogeneous systems and its relationship with disturbance intensity is limited. We examined the relationship between taxonomy-based species diversity (in terms of richness and evenness) and trait-based functional diversity of riparian and upland vegetation and determined if the slopes of this relationship vary with disturbance intensity. We used data from riparian and upland plant communities subjected to three categorical disturbance intensities (low¼uncut mature forests, intermediate¼riparian buffers around clearcuts and riparian buffers around clearcutsþsoil scarification, and high¼clearcuts and clearcutsþsoil scarification) along 24 small streams of boreal forests in northwestern Ontario, Canada. For all disturbance intensities and habitat types (riparian vs. upland), the relationships between species diversity and functional diversity were positive and non-zero, but the slopes of these relationships varied significantly with disturbance intensities. In species richness vs. functional richness relationship, the slopes were steep at low and high disturbances and relatively less steep at moderate disturbance; however, patterns were less clear in species evenness vs. functional evenness relationship. Differential distributions of species richness per trait were, in part, associated with this variation in slope. In richness (opposite for evenness), less steep slopes were associated with relatively uniform distribution of species richness per trait compared to non-uniform distribution at steep slopes, where competitive (low disturbance) and disturbance-tolerant (high disturbance) traits dominated. Our results confirm that species diversity is a good indicator of ecosystem stability but it depends on ecosystem disturbance history. More importantly, this study suggests that different components of species diversity (e.g., richness and evenness) and the distribution of species richness per trait together can summarize the stability of an ecosystem more accurately than prediction made from species diversity alone.},

abstract = {Three markedly different models of multispecies competition- one mechanistic, one phenomenological, and one statistical- all predict that greater diversity increases the temporal stability of the entire community, decreases the temporal stability of individual populations, and increases community productivity. We define temporal stability as the ratio of mean abundance to its standard deviation. Interestingly, the temporal stability of entire communities is predicted to increase fairly linearly, without clear saturation, as diversity increases. Species composition is predicted to be as important as diversity in affecting community stability and productivity. The greater temporal stability of more diverse communities is causedby higher productivity at higher diversity (the "overyielding" effect), competitive interactions (the "covariance" effect), and statistical averaging (the "portfolio" effect). The relative contribution of each cause of temporal stability changes as diversity increases, but the net effect is that greater diversity stabilizes the community even though it destabilizes individual populations. This theory agrees with recent experiments and provides a degree of resolution to the diversitystabilitydebate: both sides of the longstanding debate were correct, but one addressed population stability and the other addressed community stability},

abstract = {Functional diversity is a component of biodiversity that generally concerns the range of things that organisms do in communities and ecosystems. Here, we review how functional diversity can explain and predict the impact of organisms on ecosystems and thereby provide a mechanistic link between the two. Critical points in developing predictive measures of functional diversity are the choice of functional traits with which organisms are distinguished, how the diversity of that trait information is summarized into a measure of functional diversity, and that the measures of functional diversity are validated through quantitative analyses and experimental tests. There is a vast amount of trait information available for plant species and a substantial amount for animals. Choosing which traits to include in a particular measure of functional diversity will depend on the specific aims of a particular study. Quantitative methods for choosing traits and for assigning weighting to traits are being developed, but need much more work before we can be confident about trait choice. The number of ways of measuring functional diversity is growing rapidly. We divide them into four main groups. The first, the number of functional groups or types, has significant problems and researchers are more frequently using measures that do not require species to be grouped. Of these, some measure diversity by summarizing distances between species in trait space, some by estimating the size of the dendrogram required to describe the difference, and some include information about species' abundances. We show some new and important differences between these, as well as what they indicate about the responses of assemblages to loss of individuals. There is good experimental and analytical evidence that functional diversity can provide a link between organisms and ecosystems but greater validation of measures is required. We suggest that non-significant results have a range of alternate explanations that do not necessarily contradict positive effects of functional diversity. Finally, we suggest areas for development of techniques used to measure functional diversity, highlight some exciting questions that are being addressed using ideas about functional diversity, and suggest some directions for novel research.},

abstract = {Human-driven ecosystem simplification has highlighted questions about how the number of species in an ecosystem influences its functioning. Although biodiversity is now known to affect ecosystem productivity, its effects on stability are debated. Here we present a long-term experimental field test of the diversity-stability hypothesis. During a decade of data collection in an experiment that directly controlled the number of perennial prairie species, growing-season climate varied considerably, causing year-to-year variation in abundances of plant species and in ecosystem productivity. We found that greater numbers of plant species led to greater temporal stability of ecosystem annual aboveground plant production. In particular, the decadal temporal stability of the ecosystem, whether measured with intervals of two, five or ten years, was significantly greater at higher plant diversity and tended to increase as plots matured. Ecosystem stability was also positively dependent on root mass, which is a measure of perenniating biomass. Temporal stability of the ecosystem increased with diversity, despite a lower temporal stability of individual species, because of both portfolio (statistical averaging) and overyielding effects. However, we found no evidence of a covariance effect. Our results indicate that the reliable, efficient and sustainable supply of some foods (for example, livestock fodder), biofuels and ecosystem services can be enhanced by the use of biodiversity.},

abstract = {Recently, we noted (Qiao, Escobar, Saupe, Ji, {\&} Soberon, 2016) that multivariate kernel density estimation (KDE) may not outperform other methods for estimating hypervolume geometries and, moreover, under certain circumstances the algorithm would not detect ‘holes' in environmental space, as Blonder, Lamanna, Violle, and Enquist (2014) had proposed. In our original note (Qiao et al., 2016), we explained that KDE (a) is sensitive to both sample size and environmental dimensionality, (b) may overestimate niche volumes in low dimensions and constrict niche volume estimates in high dimensions, and (c) is useful only to the extent that the realized niche is sought and not the fundamental niche. Here, we also note that bandwidth is a crucial parameter for KDE, and its selection needs to be evaluated rigorously and all assumptions stated clearly. In their response to our comments, Blonder et al. (2017) indicated that (a) KDE output depends in useful ways on dataset size and bias, (b) other species distribution modelling methods make equally stringent but different assumptions about dataset bias, (c) we made an incorrect data transformation in our original experiments that may result in unfair comparisons, and (d) hypervolume methods are more general than KDE and have other benefits for niche modelling. We address these points below, which we divide into two main categories: methodological concerns and theoretical concerns.},

abstract = {To clarify the causes and history of forest loss in Indonesia from 1950 to 2015, we compiled and analyzed national-level statistics and literature relating to forest cover change. In 1950, nearly 159.0 Mha (87.0{\%}) of the total land area (182.7 million hectares or Mha) in Indonesia was estimated to be covered by forest. Between 1950 and 1997, 59.0 Mha of forest was deforested, while 7.1 Mha of arable land, 10.2 Mha of permanent crop, and 41.7 Mha of "other" land category were increased. Between 1997 and 2015, 5.6 Mha of arable land and 11.3 Mha of land for permanent crop were increased, while 9.0 Mha of forest and 7.9 Mha of the "other" category decreased. Prior to 1970, no trend of severe forest loss was apparent. Between 1970 and the mid-1990s, export-oriented log production and global demand were the primary pressures underlying deforestation. Cultivation of rice and other crops was also found to be associated with a growing population and transmigration policy. Moreover, deregulation of foreign investment in the 1980s appears to have led to expansion of an export-oriented industry, including commercial crop and log production. Between the mid-1990s and 2015, imbalance between global demand and production of Indonesian timber and oil palm led to illegal or non-sustainable timber harvest and expansion of permanent agricultural areas. Since 2011, regulation of forestry practices coupled with a tree planting movement have been promoted, resulting in the amelioration of deforestation rates.},

@article{Standish2014,
abstract = {Increasingly, the success of management interventions aimed at biodiversity conservation are viewed as being dependent on the 'resilience' of the system. Although the term 'resilience' is increasingly used by policy makers and environmental managers, the concept of 'resilience' remains vague, varied and difficult to quantify. Here we clarify what this concept means from an ecological perspective, and how it can be measured and applied to ecosystem management. We argue that thresholds of disturbance are central to measuring resilience. Thresholds are important because they offer a means to quantify how much disturbance an ecosystem can absorb before switching to another state, and so indicate whether intervention might be necessary to promote the recovery of the pre-disturbance state. We distinguish between helpful resilience, where resilience helps recovery, and unhelpful resilience where it does not, signalling the presence of a threshold and the need for intervention. Data to determine thresholds are not always available and so we consider the potential for indices of functional diversity to act as proxy measures of resilience. We also consider the contributions of connectivity and scale to resilience and how to incorporate these factors into management. We argue that linking thresholds to functional diversity indices may improve our ability to predict the resilience of ecosystems to future, potentially novel, disturbances according to their spatial and temporal scales of influence. Throughout, we provide guidance for the application of the resilience concept to ecosystem management. In doing so, we confirm its usefulness for improving biodiversity conservation in our rapidly changing world. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Questions: Functional redundancy in assemblages may insure ecosystem pro- cesses after perturbation, potentially causing temporary or permanent local spe- cies extinctions. Yet, functional redundancy has only been inferred by indirect evidence or measured by methods that may not be the most appropriate. Here, we apply an existing method to measure functional redundancy, which is the fraction of species diversity not expressed by functional diversity, to assess whether functional redundancy affects community resilience after disturbance. Location: Subtropical grassland, south Brazil (30°05′46″S, 51°40′37″W). Method: Species traits and community composition were assessed in quadrats before grazing and after community recovery. Grazing intensity (G)was mea- sured in each quadrat.We used traits linked to grazing intensity to define func- tional redundancy (FR)asthe difference of Gini–Simpson index of species diversity (D) and Rao's quadratic entropy (Q). Also, with the same traits, we defined community functional stability (S) as the similarity between trait-based community composition before grazing and 47 and 180 d after grazing ending. Using path analysis we assessed different postulated causal models linking functional diversity (Q), functional redundancy (FR), grazing intensity (G)and community-weightedmean traits to community stability (S) under grazing. Results: Path analysis revealed themost valid causal model FR ? S G,with a significant positive path coefficient for FR ? S and a marginally significant negative one for S G.Since FR and G were independent in their covariation and in their effects on S, themodel discriminated community resistance to graz- ing (the effect of G on S) from community resilience after grazing caused by functional redundancy (indicated by the effect of FR on S). Conclusion:We showthat expressing functional redundancymathematically is a useful tool for testing causal models linking diversity to community stability. The results support the conclusion that functional redundancy enhanced com- munity resilience, therefore corroborating the insurance hypothesis.},

abstract = {Although our knowledge on the stabilising role of biodiversity and on how it is affected by per- turbations has greatly improved, we still lack a comprehensive view on ecosystem stability that is transversal to different habitats and perturbations. Hence, we propose a framework that takes advantage of the multiplicity of components of an ecosystem and their contribution to stability. Ecosystem components can range from species or functional groups, to different functional traits, or even the cover of different habitats in a landscape mosaic. We make use of n-dimensional hypervolumes to define ecosystem states and assess how much they shift after environmental changes have occurred. We demonstrate the value of this framework with a study case on the effects of environmental change on Alpine ecosystems. Our results highlight the importance of a multidimensional approach when studying ecosystem stability and show that our framework is flexible enough to be applied to different types of ecosystem components, which can have impor- tant implications for the study of ecosystem stability and transient dynamics.},

However, observed hypervol-umes (e.g., realized niches) could also have holes, defined as unoccu-pied hyperspace representing deviations from these expectations that may indicate unconsidered ecological or evolutionary processes. De-tecting holes in more than two dimensions has to date not been possi-ble.

A quantitative model, based on canonical correlation analysis applied in Fuerteventura Island (Canary Archipelago), detected indicators of human–landscape relationships and predicted potential shifts based on simulated environmental changes. In the last few decades, the landscape of Fuerteventura Island has changed: natural components and cultural agrarian uses have decreased, while the population has increased due to immigration, mainly from mainland Spain and other European countries. The island shows a transition from a coupled local socio-ecosystem to one based on the interaction between environment and coastal tourism that decouples native inhabitants from the landscape and traditional land-use practices. As vulnerability and adaptation to climate change represent critical sets of potential interactions in Canary Islands, a model and a map of the socio-ecological system under four Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios show rural decoupling through ‘deagrarianization' and ‘deruralization', as well as stronger links to the tourism system.},

abstract = {14 1. The lowland forest of Borneo is threatened by rapid logging for timber export and clearing for the 15 expansion of timber and oil palm plantations. The combination of these two processes leaves behind 16 landscapes dotted with small, often heavily degraded forest fragments. The biodiversity value of 17 such fragments, which are easily dismissed as worthless, is uncertain. 18 2. We collected 187 taxa of staphylinid beetles across a land-use gradient in Sabah, Malaysia, 19 spanning pristine tropical lowland forest to heavily-degraded forest. Using these data, we identified 20 shifts in alpha-, beta-, and gamma-diversity in response to forest quality and forest area, and applied 21 our findings from continuous expanses of forest to make predictions on hypothetical forest 22 fragments. 23 3. We found that maintaining high forest quality is important for conserving rare taxa (those important 24 for conserving biodiversity per se), and that very small fragments (10 ha) are likely to harbour the 25 same richness of staphylinids as larger fragments (100 ha) of the same forest quality. We estimate a 26 decline in staphylinid richness of just 16{\%} following the removal of 90{\%} of the vegetation biomass 27 from a fragment within this area range. 28 4. Maintaining large forest areas is important for conserving common taxa, likely to be more important 29 for conserving ecosystem functioning. Our analyses suggest that 100 ha fragments of heavily-30 degraded forest can support the same or greater diversity of common taxa as 100 ha fragments of 31 pristine forest. We find that reducing 100 ha fragments to 10 ha fragments will likely result in the loss 32 of just 11{\%} of common taxa diversity. 33 5. Despite significant declines in alpha-diversity, beta-diversity within small rainforest fragments will 34 likely partially mitigate the loss of gamma-diversity, reinforcing the concept that beta-diversity is a 35 dominant force determining the conservation of species in fragmented landscapes. 36 6. Synthesis and applications. In contrast to previous findings on larger animals, our results suggest that even small fragments of degraded forest might be important reservoirs of invertebrate biodiversity in tropical agriculture landscapes. These fragments should be conserved where they occur and form an integral part of management for more sustainable agriculture in tropical landscapes.},

To explore this influence, we measured the biomass of microalgae grown in microcosms along two stress gradients, heat and salinity, and compared our results with 13 published case studies that measured biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships under varying environmental conditions. We found that positive effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning decreased with increasing stress intensity in absolute terms. However, in relative terms, increasing stress had a stronger negative effect on low-diversity communities. This shows that more diverse biotic communities are functionally less susceptible to environmental stress, emphasises the need to maintain high levels of biodiversity as an insurance against impacts of changing environmental conditions and sets the stage for exploring the mechanisms underlying biodiversity effects in stressed ecosystems.},

abstract = {Aim This study focuses on the influence of methodological choices on the predictive performance of macroecological models (MEMs), i.e. statistical models designed to predict patterns of biodiversity using environmental predictors. We emphasize the influence of three methodological choices: (1) the choice of the currency in which the abundance of each species is measured, i.e. numbers of individuals or biomass; (2) the rules used to define the species assemblage under focus, i.e. broad communities or refined ecological guilds; and (3) the influence of rare over common species in the biodiversity measure. Location The effects of these choices are investigated using an exhaustive dataset on the fish fauna of the continental shelf of the Barents Sea. Methods We conducted an analysis of 220 models resulting from all possible combinations of the three methodological choices. For each, we evaluated the predictive performance through an iterative cross-validation process. Results All methodological choices we investigated strongly affected the predictive performance of MEMs. High predictive performances were obtained when using biomass instead of numbers of individuals, when focusing on narrow ecological guilds composed of species sharing the same ecological traits and when using diversity measures that give high weight to rare species. Main conclusions We recommend that future projections of biodiversity pay more attention to abundance currency, ecological homogeneity of focal species assemblages and the diversity metric used, and systematically investigate these methodological choices prior to producing biodiversity forecasts. Splitting a whole set of species into ecological guilds appears to be a promising practice, leading to a selected set of MEMs with high predictive performances and more detailed forecasts on the fate of diversity.},

To achieve this goal, transformations are proposed for species data tables. They allow ecologists to use ordination methods such as PCA and RDA, which are Euclidean-based, for the analysis of community data, while circumventing the problems associated with the Euclidean distance, and avoiding CA and CCA which present problems of their own in some cases. This allows the use of the original (transformed) species data in RDA carried out to test for relationships with explanatory variables (i.e. environ- $\backslash$nmental variables, or factors of a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model); ecologists can then draw biplots displaying the relationships of the species to the explanatory variables. Another application allows the use of species data in other methods of multivariate data analysis which optimize a least-squares loss function; an example is K-means partitioning.},

abstract = {Hypervolume approaches are used to quantify functional diversity and quantify environmental niches for species distribution modelling. Recently, Qiao et al. (2016) criticized our geometrical ker- nel density estimation (KDE) method for measuring hypervolumes. They used a simulation analysis to argue that the method yields high error rates and makes biased estimates of fundamental niches. Here, we show that (a) KDE output depends in useful ways on dataset size and bias, (b) other species distribution modelling methods make equally stringent but different assumptions about dataset bias, (c) simulation results presented by Qiao et al. (2016) were incorrect, with revised analyses showing performance comparable to other methods, and (d) hypervolume meth- ods are more general than KDE and have other benefits for niche modelling. As a result, our KDE method remains a promising tool for species distribution modelling.},

abstract = {1. Hutchinson's n-dimensional hypervolume concept underlies many applications in contemporary ecology and evolutionary biology. Estimating hypervolumes from sampled data has been an ongoing challenge due to conceptual and computational issues. 2. We present new algorithms for delineating the boundaries and probability density within n-dimensional hypervolumes. The methods produce smooth boundaries that can fit data either more loosely (Gaussian kernel density estimation) or more tightly (one-classification via support vector machine). Further, the algorithms can accept abundance-weighted data, and the resulting hypervolumes can be given a probabil- istic interpretation and projected into geographic space. 3. We demonstrate the properties of these methods on a large dataset that character- ises the functional traits and geographic distribution of thousands of plants. The methods are available in version ≥2.0.7 of the HYPERVOLUME R package. 4. These new algorithms provide: (i) a more robust approach for delineating the shape and density of n-dimensional hypervolumes; (ii) more efficient performance on large and high-dimensional datasets; and (iii) improved measures of functional diversity and environmental niche breadth.

abstract = {The composition of species communities is changing rapidly through drivers such as habitat loss and climate change, with potentially serious consequences for the resilience of ecosystem functions on which humans depend. To assess such changes in resilience, we analyse trends in the frequency of species in Great Britain that provide key ecosystem functions-specifically decomposition, carbon sequestration, pollination, pest control and cultural values. For 4,424 species over four decades, there have been significant net declines among animal species that provide pollination, pest control and cultural values. Groups providing decomposition and carbon sequestration remain relatively stable, as fewer species are in decline and these are offset by large numbers of new arrivals into Great Britain. While there is general concern about degradation of a wide range of ecosystem functions, our results suggest actions should focus on particular functions for which there is evidence of substantial erosion of their resilience.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {Land use intensification can greatly reduce species richness and ecosystem functioning. However, species richness determines ecosystem functioning through the diversity and values of traits of species present. Here, we analyze changes in species richness and functional diversity (FD) at varying agricultural land use intensity levels. We test hypotheses of FD responses to land use intensification in plant, bird, and mammal communities using trait data compiled for 1600+ species. To isolate changes in FD from changes in species richness we compare the FD of communities to the null expectations of FD values. In over one-quarter of the bird and mammal communities impacted by agriculture, declines in FD were steeper than predicted by species number. In plant communities, changes in FD were indistinguishable from changes in species richness. Land use intensification can reduce the functional diversity of animal communities beyond changes in species richness alone, potentially imperiling provisioning of ecosystem services.},
