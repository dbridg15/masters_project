abstract = {World food demand is expected to more than double by 2050. Decisions about how to meet this challenge will have profound effects on wild species and habitats. We show that farming is already the greatest extinction threat to birds (the best known taxon), and its adverse impacts look set to increase, especially in developing countries. Two competing solutions have been proposed: wildlife-friendly farming (which boosts densities of wild populations on farmland but may decrease agricultural yields) and land sparing (which minimizes demand for farmland by increasing yield). We present a model that identifies how to resolve the trade-off between these approaches. This shows that the best type of farming for species persistence depends on the demand for agricultural products and on how the population densities of different species on farmland change with agricultural yield. Empirical data on such density-yield functions are sparse, but evidence from a range of taxa in developing countries suggests that high-yield farming may allow more species to persist.},

abstract = {Positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has been observed in many studies, but how this relationship is affected by environmental stress is largely unknown. To explore this influence, we measured the biomass of microalgae grown in microcosms along two stress gradients, heat and salinity, and compared our results with 13 published case studies that measured biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships under varying environmental conditions. We found that positive effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning decreased with increasing stress intensity in absolute terms. However, in relative terms, increasing stress had a stronger negative effect on low-diversity communities. This shows that more diverse biotic communities are functionally less susceptible to environmental stress, emphasises the need to maintain high levels of biodiversity as an insurance against impacts of changing environmental conditions and sets the stage for exploring the mechanisms underlying biodiversity effects in stressed ecosystems.},

abstract = {Theory predicts shifts in the magnitude and direction of biodiversity effects on ecosystem function (BEF) over succession, but this theory remains largely untested. We studied the relationship between aboveground tree biomass dynamics ($\Delta$biomass) and multiple dimensions of biodiversity over 8–16 years in eight successional rainforests. We tested whether successional changes in diversity–$\Delta$biomass correlations reflect predictions of niche theories. Diversity–$\Delta$biomass correlations were positive early but weak later in succession, suggesting saturation of niche space with increasing diversity. Early in succession, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity in two leaf traits exhibited the strongest positive correlations with $\Delta$biomass, indicating complementarity or positive selection effects. In mid-successional stands, high biodiversity was associated with greater mortality-driven biomass loss, i.e. negative selection effects, suggesting successional niche trade-offs and loss of fast-growing pioneer species. Our results demonstrate that BEF relationships are dynamic across succession, thus successional context is essential to understanding BEF in a given system.},

abstract = {Use of reduced-impact logging (RIL) techniques has repeatedly been shown to reduce damage caused by logging. Unfortunately, these techniques do not necessarily ameliorate the low growth rates of many commercial species or otherwise assure recovery of the initial volume harvested during the next cutting cycle. In this study, we analyze the effect of logging and application of additional silvicultural treatments (liana cutting and girdling of competing trees) on the growth rates on trees in general and on of future crop trees (FCTs) of 24 commercial timber species. The study was carried out in a moist tropical forest in Bolivia, where we monitored twelve 27-ha plots for 4 years. Plots received one of four treatments in which logging intensity and silvicultural treatments were varied: control (no logging); normal (reduced-impact) logging; normal logging and low-intensity silviculture; and, increased logging intensity and high-intensity silviculture. Tree growth rates increased with intensity of logging and silvicultural treatments. The growth rates of FCTs of commercial species were 50-60{\%} higher in plots that received silvicultural treatments than in the normal logging and control plots. Responses to silvicultural treatments varied among functional groups. The largest increase in growth rates was observed in FCTs belonging to the partially shade-tolerant and the shade-tolerant groups. These results indicate that silvicultural treatments, in addition to the use of RIL techniques, are more likely to result in a higher percentage of timber volume being recovered after the first cutting cycle than RIL alone. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak are global hotspots of forest loss and degradation due to timber and oil palm industries; however, the rates and patterns of change have remained poorly measured by conventional field or satellite approaches. Using 30 m resolution optical imagery acquired since 1990, forest cover and logging roads were mapped throughout Malaysian Borneo and Brunei using the Carnegie Landsat Analysis System. We uncovered ∼364,000 km of roads constructed through the forests of this region. We estimated that in 2009 there were at most 45,400 km(2) of intact forest ecosystems in Malaysian Borneo and Brunei. Critically, we found that nearly 80{\%} of the land surface of Sabah and Sarawak was impacted by previously undocumented, high-impact logging or clearing operations from 1990 to 2009. This contrasted strongly with neighbouring Brunei, where 54{\%} of the land area remained covered by unlogged forest. Overall, only 8{\%} and 3{\%} of land area in Sabah and Sarawak, respectively, was covered by intact forests under designated protected areas. Our assessment shows that very few forest ecosystems remain intact in Sabah or Sarawak, but that Brunei, by largely excluding industrial logging from its borders, has been comparatively successful in protecting its forests.},

They used a simulation analysis to argue that the method yields high error rates and makes biased estimates of fundamental niches. Here, we show that (a) KDE output depends in useful ways on dataset size and bias, (b) other species distribution modelling methods make equally stringent but different assumptions about dataset bias, (c) simulation results presented by Qiao et al.

As a result, our KDE method remains a promising tool for species distribution modelling.},

abstract = {Tropical forests hold large stores of carbon, yet uncertainty remains regarding their quantitative contribution to the global carbon cycle. One approach to quantifying carbon biomass stores consists in inferring changes from long-term forest inventory plots. Regression models are used to convert inventory data into an estimate of aboveground biomass (AGB). We provide a critical reassessment of the quality and the robustness of these models across tropical forest types, using a large dataset of 2,410 trees ! 5 cm. diameter, directly harvested in 27 study sites across the tropics. Proportional relationships between aboveground biomass and the product of wood density, trunk cross-sectional area, and total height are constructed. We also develop a regression model involving wood density and stem diameter only. Our models were tested for secondary and old-growth forests, for dry, moist and wet forests, for lowland and montane forests, and for mangrove forests. The most important predictors of AGB of a tree were, in decreasing order of importance, its trunk diameter, wood specific gravity, total height, and forest type (dry, moist, or wet). Overestimates prevailed, giving a bias of 0.5-6.5{\%} when errors were averaged across all stands. Our regression models can be used reliably to predict aboveground tree biomass across a broad range of tropical forests. Because they are based on an unprecedented dataset, these models should improve the quality of tropical biomass estimates, and bring consensus about the contribution of the tropical forest biome and tropical deforestation to the global carbon cycle.},

In this article, we investigate the relationship between species diversity and the stability of community biomass in the face of stochastic perturbations of species' abundances. The model explicitly includes species' interactions. We show that the pattern of species' interactions affects whether the relationship between diversity and biomass stability is positive or negative. In particular, assumptions about community structure influence the relationship between species diversity and community biomass, which in turn influences the diversity-stability relationship. We also discuss the relationship between diversity and another type of stability, the proportional change in community biomass with the extinction or introduction of a species. Regardless of community type, diversity buffers the change in biomass when a species is added or removed.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Springer Science+Business Media DordrechtThe ecological resilience of abandoned pastures has important implications for the potential of passive restoration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, especially in the face of the ambitious restoration targets for this biodiversity hotspot. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the influence of past land-use on natural regeneration in two secondary forests that established on abandoned pastures with different land use histories (Abandoned + Fire—15 years since the last fire event and Abandoned—36 years ago) in a lowland Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Both secondary forests exhibit low resilience for the three analyzed attributes: vegetation structure, richness, and species composition. Secondary forests affected by fire have the lowest values for species richness, aboveground biomass and leaf area index compared to old-growth forests. Secondary forests were dominated by Moquiniastrum polymorphum—Asteraceae, which was absent from the old-growth forests. Fire resistance, capacity to establish in nutrient-poor soils and efficient seed dispersal in human-modified landscapes are important attributes that may explain the dominance of this species. We demonstrate that even in sites considered appropriate for passive restoration a priori (e.g. located in a protected area, 36 years since abandonment and close to old-growth forests), secondary forests exhibited low aboveground biomass and communities were dominated by few species. Therefore, our results highlight the effects of past land-use on natural regeneration and suggest the necessity to use interventions such as enrichment plantings, nucleation techniques and assisted natural regeneration in order to accelerate forest restoration.},

abstract = {ONE of the ecological tenets justifying conservation of biodiversity is that diversity begets stability. Impacts of biodiversity on population dynamics and ecosystem functioning have long been debated1-7, however, with many theoretical explorations2-6,8-11 but few field studies12-15. Here we describe a long-term study of grasslands16,17 which shows that primary productivity in more diverse plant communities is more resistant to, and recovers more fully from, a major drought. The curvilinear relationship we observe suggests that each additional species lost from our grasslands had a progressively greater impact on drought resistance. Our results support the diversity-stability hypothesis5,6,18,19, but not the alternative hypothesis that most species are functionally redundant19-21. This study implies that the preservation of biodiversity is essential for the maintenance of stable productivity in ecosystems.},

Some hypervolumes are expected to be convex, with boundaries defined by only upper and lower limits (e.g., fundamental niches), while others are expected to be maximal, with boundaries defined by the limits of available space (e.g., potential niches). However, observed hypervol-umes (e.g., realized niches) could also have holes, defined as unoccu-pied hyperspace representing deviations from these expectations that may indicate unconsidered ecological or evolutionary processes. De-tecting holes in more than two dimensions has to date not been possi-ble. I develop a mathematical approach, implemented in the hyper-volume R package, to infer holes in large and high-dimensional data sets. As a demonstration analysis, I assess evidence for vacant niches in a Galapagos finch community on Isabela Island. These mathematical concepts and software tools for detecting holes provide approaches for addressing contemporary research questions across ecology and evolu-tionary biology.},

abstract = {The Malaysian oil palm industry is one of the most highly organised sectors of any national agriculture system of the world. Today, though, the focus has shifted to how well agriculture also meets universally accepted standards of sustainability. This paper highlights the development of oil palm cultivation and responsible farming practices in Malaysia, the world's largest producer of palm oil. The oil palm has had a natural head start in fulfilling sustainability indicators due to its plant physiology of high productivity and efficient carbon assimilation. Over the last 50 years, R{\&}D activities and technological advances have helped raise yields and reduce inputs, thereby maximising oil production from a smaller land area than used for other food crops. Palm oil is now a major source of sustainable and renewable raw material for the world's food, oleochemical and biofuel industries. Involvement in cultivation or downstream activities has uplifted the quality of life of people, a key plank of the sustainability platform. In particular, this has helped alleviate poverty among landless farmers in Malaysia. Industry players have recently joined hands with other stakeholders to pursue certification of sustainably produced palm oil with full traceability. Also being explored are measures to conserve forests with high value and the wildlife population.},

However, species richness determines ecosystem functioning through the diversity and values of traits of species present. Here, we analyze changes in species richness and functional diversity (FD) at varying agricultural land use intensity levels. We test hypotheses of FD responses to land use intensification in plant, bird, and mammal communities using trait data compiled for 1600+ species. To isolate changes in FD from changes in species richness we compare the FD of communities to the null expectations of FD values. In over one-quarter of the bird and mammal communities impacted by agriculture, declines in FD were steeper than predicted by species number. In plant communities, changes in FD were indistinguishable from changes in species richness. Land use intensification can reduce the functional diversity of animal communities beyond changes in species richness alone, potentially imperiling provisioning of ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Functional diversity is a component of biodiversity that generally concerns the range of things that organisms do in communities and ecosystems. Here, we review how functional diversity can explain and predict the impact of organisms on ecosystems and thereby provide a mechanistic link between the two. Critical points in developing predictive measures of functional diversity are the choice of functional traits with which organisms are distinguished, how the diversity of that trait information is summarized into a measure of functional diversity, and that the measures of functional diversity are validated through quantitative analyses and experimental tests. There is a vast amount of trait information available for plant species and a substantial amount for animals. Choosing which traits to include in a particular measure of functional diversity will depend on the specific aims of a particular study. Quantitative methods for choosing traits and for assigning weighting to traits are being developed, but need much more work before we can be confident about trait choice. The number of ways of measuring functional diversity is growing rapidly. We divide them into four main groups. The first, the number of functional groups or types, has significant problems and researchers are more frequently using measures that do not require species to be grouped. Of these, some measure diversity by summarizing distances between species in trait space, some by estimating the size of the dendrogram required to describe the difference, and some include information about species' abundances. We show some new and important differences between these, as well as what they indicate about the responses of assemblages to loss of individuals. There is good experimental and analytical evidence that functional diversity can provide a link between organisms and ecosystems but greater validation of measures is required. We suggest that non-significant results have a range of alternate explanations that do not necessarily contradict positive effects of functional diversity. Finally, we suggest areas for development of techniques used to measure functional diversity, highlight some exciting questions that are being addressed using ideas about functional diversity, and suggest some directions for novel research.},

abstract = {Increasingly, the success of management interventions aimed at biodiversity conservation are viewed as being dependent on the 'resilience' of the system. Although the term 'resilience' is increasingly used by policy makers and environmental managers, the concept of 'resilience' remains vague, varied and difficult to quantify. Here we clarify what this concept means from an ecological perspective, and how it can be measured and applied to ecosystem management. We argue that thresholds of disturbance are central to measuring resilience. Thresholds are important because they offer a means to quantify how much disturbance an ecosystem can absorb before switching to another state, and so indicate whether intervention might be necessary to promote the recovery of the pre-disturbance state. We distinguish between helpful resilience, where resilience helps recovery, and unhelpful resilience where it does not, signalling the presence of a threshold and the need for intervention. Data to determine thresholds are not always available and so we consider the potential for indices of functional diversity to act as proxy measures of resilience. We also consider the contributions of connectivity and scale to resilience and how to incorporate these factors into management. We argue that linking thresholds to functional diversity indices may improve our ability to predict the resilience of ecosystems to future, potentially novel, disturbances according to their spatial and temporal scales of influence. Throughout, we provide guidance for the application of the resilience concept to ecosystem management. In doing so, we confirm its usefulness for improving biodiversity conservation in our rapidly changing world. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {n-dimensional hypervolumes are commonly applied in ecology and evolutionary studies to describe and compare niches, trait spaces characterizing phenotypes or the functional composition of communities. Classical ecological surveys, modern analytical tools and the establishment of online data bases will produce large multivariate data sets, which demands robust statistical tools to analyse and interpret hypervolumes. Existing approaches often have weaknesses; for example, they rely on multivariate normally or elliptically distributed data, perform poorly in higher dimensions, or their outputs vary arbitrarily with parameter choice. Here we introduce dynamic range boxes as a robust nonparametric approach to quantify size and overlap of n-dimensional hypervolumes. Dynamic range boxes (implemented in the r package dynRB) improve the concept of multivariate range boxes by accounting for the distribution of the data within their range, while still no assumptions on the underlying distributions are needed. In addition to calculating the whole n-dimensional hypervolume, the package dynRB also provides functions for a coordinate-wise analysis and interpretation of the data. The concept of dynamic range boxes reliably computes sizes and overlaps of n-dimensional hypervolumes, which makes dynamic range boxes readily applicable for a broad range of data sets to answer questions related to various disciplines.},

These include production of tree biomass, soil carbon storage, berry production and game production potential. For example, biomass production was approximately 50{\%} greater with five than with one tree species. In addition, we show positive relationships between tree species richness and proxies for other biodiversity components. Importantly, no single tree species was able to promote all services, and some services were negatively correlated to each other. Management of production forests will therefore benefit from considering multiple tree species to sustain the full range of benefits that the society obtains from forests.},

This 3 clearly impacts associated freshwater ecosystems, but the impact on their biodiversity remains 4 largely understudied and poorly understood, despite the important provisioning service that 5 freshwater fishes provide for human well-being. This study quantifies the biomass stocks of 6 freshwater fish across a land use gradient encompassing primary forest, twice-logged forest and oil 7 palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysia, in an area where local communities are known to harvest 8 freshwater fish. Stream fish were sampled using a cast net, the dominant technique used by local 9 fishermen, in 200 m long transects in 16 streams over three sampling years (2011, 2013 and 2015). 10 Unexpectedly, no impact of land use on total fish availability was detected. There were no significant 11 differences in fish species richness, or most importantly, biomass per unit fishing effort across the 12 land use gradient. There was variation in the responses of five known food species (Tor tambra, 13 Hampala sabana, Barbodes sealei, Barbonymus balleroides and Gastromyzon lepidogaster), and 14 these small differences are attributed to variation in species habitat selection that co-vary with land 15 use change. Despite evidence to suggest freshwater fish communities are resilient to land use 16 change, they still face risks associated with disturbance such as invasion by alien species; 17 furthermore, several of the more stenotopic species were only present in primary forest catchments. 18 Nonetheless, freshwater fish in small headwater streams appear to represent a sustainable food 19 resource for villages established in human-modified forests or developed oil palm plantations. 20 21},

Forests are changing over a wide range of spatio-temporal scales, but it is often unclear whether these changes reduce resilience or represent a tipping point. Tipping points may arise from interac-tions across scales, as processes such as climate change, land-use change, invasive species or defor-estation gradually erode resilience and increase vulnerability to extreme events. Studies covering interactions across different spatio-temporal scales are needed to further our understanding. 3. Combinations of experiments, observations and process-based models could improve our ability to project forest resilience and tipping points under global change. We discuss uncertainties in changing CO 2 concentration and quantifying tree mortality as examples. 4. Synthesis. As forests change at various scales, it is increasingly important to understand whether and how such changes lead to reduced resilience and potential tipping points.

Approximately 9 million types of plants, animals, protists and fungi inhabit the Earth. So, too, do 7 billion people. Two decades ago, at the first Earth Summit, the vast majority of the world's nations declared that human actions were dismantling the Earth's ecosystems, eliminating genes, species and biological traits at an alarming rate. This observation led to the question of how such loss of biological diversity will alter the functioning of ecosystems and their ability to provide society with the goods and services needed to prosper.},

abstract = {Aim Concerns over how global change will influence species distributions, in conjunction with increased emphasis on understanding niche dynamics in evolu- tionary and community contexts, highlight the growing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences between or within taxa.We propose a statistical frame- work to describe and compare environmental niches from occurrence and spatial environmental data. Location Europe, North America and South America. Methods The framework applies kernel smoothers to densities of species occur- rence in gridded environmental space to calculatemetrics of niche overlap and test hypotheses regarding niche conservatism. We use this framework and simulated species with pre-defined distributions and amounts of niche overlap to evaluate several ordination and species distribution modelling techniques for quantifying niche overlap. We illustrate the approach with data on two well-studied invasive species. Results We show that niche overlap can be accurately detected with the frame- work when variables driving the distributions are known. The method is robust to known and previously undocumented biases related to the dependence of species occurrences on the frequency of environmental conditions that occur across geo- graphical space. The use of a kernel smoother makes the process of moving from geographical space tomultivariate environmental space independent of both sam- pling effort and arbitrary choice of resolution in environmental space.However, the use of ordination and species distributionmodel techniques for selecting, combin- ing and weighting variables on which niche overlap is calculated provide contrast- ing results. Main conclusions The framework meets the increasing need for robust methods to quantify niche differences. It is appropriate for studying niche differences between species, subspecies or intra-specific lineages that differ in their geographi- cal distributions. Alternatively, it can be used to measure the degree to which the environmental niche of a species or intra-specific lineage has changed over time. Keywords},

abstract = {Growing concern about how loss of biodiversity will affect ecosystems has stimulated numerous studies. Although most studies have assumed that species go extinct randomly, species often go extinct in order of their sensitivity to a stress that intensifies through time (such as climate change). Here we show that the consequences of random and ordered extinctions differ. Both depend on food-web interactions that create compensation; that is, the increase of some species when their competitors and/or predators decrease in density due to environmental stress. Compensation makes communities as a whole more resistant to stress by reducing changes in combined species densities. As extinctions progress, the potential for compensation is depleted, and communities become progressively less resistant. For ordered extinctions, however, this depletion is offset and communities retain their resistance, because the surviving species have greater average resistance to the stress. Despite extinctions being ordered, changes in the food web with successive extinctions make it difficult to predict which species will show compensation in the future. This unpredictability argues for {\&}apos;whole-ecosystem{\&}apos; approaches to biodiversity conservation, as seemingly insignificant species may become important after other species go extinct.},

To assess such changes in resilience, we analyse trends in the frequency of species in Great Britain that provide key ecosystem functions-specifically decomposition, carbon sequestration, pollination, pest control and cultural values. For 4,424 species over four decades, there have been significant net declines among animal species that provide pollination, pest control and cultural values. Groups providing decomposition and carbon sequestration remain relatively stable, as fewer species are in decline and these are offset by large numbers of new arrivals into Great Britain. While there is general concern about degradation of a wide range of ecosystem functions, our results suggest actions should focus on particular functions for which there is evidence of substantial erosion of their resilience.},

abstract = {Rising global demands for food and biofuels are driving forest clearance in the tropics. Oil-palm expansion contributes to biodiversity declines and carbon emissions in Southeast Asia. However, the magnitudes of these impacts remain largely unquantified until now. We produce a 250-m spatial resolution map of closed canopy oil-palm plantations in the lowlands of Peninsular Malaysia (2 million ha), Borneo (2.4 million ha), and Sumatra (3.9 million ha). We demonstrate that 6{\%} (or ≈880,000 ha) of tropical peatlands in the region had been converted to oil-palm plantations by the early 2000s. Conversion of peatswamp forests to oil palm led to biodiversity declines of 1{\%} in Borneo (equivalent to four species of forest-dwelling birds), 3.4{\%} in Sumatra (16 species), and 12.1{\%} in Peninsular Malaysia (46 species). This land-use change also contributed to the loss of ≈140 million Mg of aboveground biomass carbon, and annual emissions of ≈4.6 million Mg of belowground carbon from peat oxidation. Additionally, the loss of peatswamp forests implies the loss of carbon sequestration service through peat accumulation, which amounts to ≈660,000 Mg of carbon annually. By 2010, 2.3 million ha of peatswamp forests were clear-felled, and currently occur as degraded lands. Reforestation of these clearings could enhance biodiversity by up to ≈20{\%}, whereas oil-palm establishment would exacerbate species losses by up to ≈12{\%}. To safeguard the region's biodiversity and carbon stocks, conservation and reforestation efforts should target Central Kalimantan, Riau, and West Kalimantan, which retain three-quarters (3.9 million ha) of the remaining peatswamp forests in Southeast Asia.},

abstract = {Questions: Functional redundancy in assemblages may insure ecosystem pro- cesses after perturbation, potentially causing temporary or permanent local spe- cies extinctions. Yet, functional redundancy has only been inferred by indirect evidence or measured by methods that may not be the most appropriate. Here, we apply an existing method to measure functional redundancy, which is the fraction of species diversity not expressed by functional diversity, to assess whether functional redundancy affects community resilience after disturbance. Location: Subtropical grassland, south Brazil (30°05′46″S, 51°40′37″W). Method: Species traits and community composition were assessed in quadrats before grazing and after community recovery. Grazing intensity (G)was mea- sured in each quadrat.We used traits linked to grazing intensity to define func- tional redundancy (FR)asthe difference of Gini–Simpson index of species diversity (D) and Rao's quadratic entropy (Q). Also, with the same traits, we defined community functional stability (S) as the similarity between trait-based community composition before grazing and 47 and 180 d after grazing ending. Using path analysis we assessed different postulated causal models linking functional diversity (Q), functional redundancy (FR), grazing intensity (G)and community-weightedmean traits to community stability (S) under grazing. Results: Path analysis revealed themost valid causal model FR ? S G,with a significant positive path coefficient for FR ? S and a marginally significant negative one for S G.Since FR and G were independent in their covariation and in their effects on S, themodel discriminated community resistance to graz- ing (the effect of G on S) from community resilience after grazing caused by functional redundancy (indicated by the effect of FR on S). Conclusion:We showthat expressing functional redundancymathematically is a useful tool for testing causal models linking diversity to community stability. The results support the conclusion that functional redundancy enhanced com- munity resilience, therefore corroborating the insurance hypothesis.},

abstract = {Understanding the ways in which ecological communities are affected by habitat modification is one of the conditions for effective conservation and sustainable land-management. This study used capture-mark-recapture methods to investigate the response of small non-volant mammals to tropical forest logging and conversion to oil palm at a site in Northern Borneo. Trapping grids were established in unlogged primary forest, twice logged forest and oil palm plantations as part of the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems project, a large ecological experiment investigating the effects of disturbance on tropical forest biodiversity. Measures of community structure, composition and species richness were compared between the three habitats. Species-specific densities were estimated and contrasted between the different grids using innovative spatially explicit mark-recapture techniques. Finally, habitat use at the trap-level was further investigated for the three most common species as well as for the genus Rattus by modelling detection as a function of 10 micro-habitat characteristics. A total of 23 different species were caught overall. Grids sampled in logged forest showed higher species richness and similar structure to that of the unlogged forest site. Communities in both these habitats were considerably more diverse and harboured a higher number of specialised species than in the oil palm site, which was largely populated by invasive Rattus species. For two of the three species considered (Maxomys surifer and Maxomys whiteheadi), densities were found to be markedly higher in logged forest, a response partly explained by increased ground vegetation density and a pronounced heterogeneity in micro-habitat patches. Although the design limitations of this study preclude firm conclusions, it appears that logged forests play an important role in maintaining the integrity of small mammal communities and ensuring the persistence of individual species. Recommendations concerning the use of capture-mark-recapture methods to study small mammals in tropical forests are made accordingly.},

abstract = {The native forests of Borneo have been impacted by selective logging, fire, and conversion to plantations at unprecedented scales since industrial-scale extractive industries began in the early 1970s. There is no island-wide documentation of forest clearance or logging since the 1970s. This creates an information gap for conservation planning, especially with regard to selectively logged forests that maintain high conservation potential. Analysing LANDSAT images, we estimate that 75.7{\%} (558,060 km2) of Borneo's area (737,188 km2) was forested around 1973. Based upon a forest cover map for 2010 derived using ALOS-PALSAR and visually reviewing LANDSAT images, we estimate that the 1973 forest area had declined by 168,493 km2 (30.2{\%}) in 2010. The highest losses were recorded in Sabah and Kalimantan with 39.5{\%} and 30.7{\%} of their total forest area in 1973 becoming non-forest in 2010, and the lowest in Brunei and Sarawak (8.4{\%}, and 23.1{\%}). We estimate that the combined area planted in industrial oil palm and timber plantations in 2010 was 75,480 km2, representing 10{\%} of Borneo. We mapped 271,819 km of primary logging roads that were created between 1973 and 2010. The greatest density of logging roads was found in Sarawak, at 0.89 km km−2, and the lowest density in Brunei, at 0.18 km km−2. Analyzing MODIS-based tree cover maps, we estimate that logging operated within 700 m of primary logging roads. Using this distance, we estimate that 266,257 km2 of 1973 forest cover has been logged. With 389,566 km2 (52.8{\%}) of the island remaining forested, of which 209,649 km2 remains intact. There is still hope for biodiversity conservation in Borneo. Protecting logged forests from fire and conversion to plantations is an urgent priority for reducing rates of deforestation in Borneo.},

We identify functional groups using multivariate analysis of plant traits which influence ecosystem processes. Functional redundancy is calculated as the species richness within each group, and response diversity as the multivariate within-group dispersion in response trait space, using traits that influence responses to disturbances. Meta-analysis across all datasets showed that land-use intensification significantly reduced both functional redundancy and response diversity, although specific relationships varied considerably among the different land-use gradients.

Distinguishing between these kinds of niche shifts is impossible with traditional, correlative approaches to invasion forecasts, which exclusively consider the realized niche. Here we overcome this challenge by combining a physiologically mechanistic model of the fundamental niche with correlative models based on the realized niche to study the global invasion of the cane toad Rhinella marina. We find strong evidence that the success of R. marina in Australia reflects a shift in the species' realized niche, as opposed to evolutionary shifts in range-limiting traits. Our results demonstrate that R. marina does not fill its fundamental niche in its native South American range and that areas of niche unfilling coincide with the presence of a closely related species with which R. marina hybridizes. Con-versely, in Australia, where coevolved taxa are absent, R. marina largely fills its fundamental niche in areas behind the invasion front. The general approach taken here of contrasting fundamen-tal and realized niche models provides key insights into the role of biotic interactions in shaping range limits and can inform effective management strategies not only for invasive species but also for assisted colonization under climate change. biophysical model | Bufo marinus | Maxent | range shift | species distribution model U nderstanding the factors that limit species' geographic ranges has long stood as a fundamental goal in ecology (1) and is critical for making robust predictions of species' range shifts as a result of climate change and biotic exchange. Niche theory (2) argues that species' ranges are limited by physiological tolerances (which define the fundamental niche), as well as biotic interactions and dispersal barriers (which further constrain the fundamental niche to the realized niche), but the relative roles of these factors in shaping range limits remain poorly understood. Standard approaches to range prediction are based on correla-tions between species' observed distributions and climate (i.e., the realized niche) (3, 4), and thus confound the influences of abiotic and biotic constraints on species' ranges. Range shift projections based on correlative models also as-sume that species' niches (both realized and fundamental) are conserved through space and time (3, 5, 6). However, there is growing evidence to suggest that species can undergo rapid niche shifts in novel environments (7–9) through either evolved envi-ronmental tolerances (fundamental niche shifts) (10, 11) or re-lease from dispersal barriers or biotic constraints (realized niche shifts) (12, 13). Understanding whether such niche shifts are widespread in nature not only is important for validating the use of correlative models in climate change and invasive species impact assessments but also has implications for understanding patterns of community assembly and speciation (14, 15). Invasive species frequently experience release from biotic interactions and dispersal barriers in their invaded ranges (4, 12, 16), and thus provide model systems for investigating the degree to which niches are spatially and temporally conserved. Current approaches for examining niche shifts in invasive species primarily rely on comparisons of climates occupied by species in their native and invaded ranges (6, 7, 17, 18). However, such correlative comparisons fail to differentiate between the influences of adap-tation after introduction and biotic interactions and dispersal barriers that are absent in a species' invaded range. Here we present an approach that helps resolve this issue by integrating correlative niche models with mechanistic biophysical predictions of the fundamental niche (19). Biophysical models incorporate links between climate and an organism's functional traits and are developed independent of a species' current distribution. The biophysical approach thus provides a prediction of where a species can survive and reproduce in the absence of biotic interactions and dispersal limitations (19). We apply this mechanistic approach to investigate whether the invasion of Australia by the cane toad (Rhinella marina, formerly Bufo marinus) has been facilitated by a shift in the species' realized or fundamental niche. Since its introduction to Australia in 1935 as a biological control agent, R. marina has expanded its range to include more than 1.2 million km 2 of the continent (20). This large-scale invasion has been facilitated by thermal acclimation (21, 22), as well as evolution-ary shifts in locomotor performance (23). Have the environ-mental tolerances of toads evolved as well?},

abstract = {Community ecology and ecosystem ecology provide two perspectives on complex ecological systems that have largely complementary strengths and weaknesses. Merging the two perspectives is necessary both to ensure continued scientific progress and to provide society with the scientific means to face growing environmental challenges. Recent research on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has contributed to this goal in several ways. By addressing a new question of high relevance for both science and society, by challenging existing paradigms, by tightly linking theory and experiments, by building scientific consensus beyond differences in opinion, by integrating fragmented disciplines and research fields, by connecting itself to other disciplines and management issues, it has helped transform ecology not only in content, but also in form. Creating a genuine evolutionary ecosystem ecology that links the evolution of species traits at the individual level, the dynamics of species interactions, and the overall functioning of ecosystems would give new impetus to this much-needed process of unification across ecological disciplines. Recent community evolution models are a promising step in that direction.},

abstract = {Oil palm cultivation is expanding rapidly into many of the world's most biodiverse tropical regions. One of the most functionally important and ecologically dominant animal groups in these environments is the ants. Here, we quantify the overall impacts of clear-felling lowland dipterocarp rainforest and conversion into oil palm plantation on ant diversity. At study sites in Sabah, Malaysia we collected ants from three microhabitats: 1 - the canopy, 2 - bird's nest ferns (Asplenium nidus complex, a common epiphyte in forest and oil palm), and 3 - leaf litter. We also measured temperature, humidity and light at collection sites to assess their impacts on ant community composition. Total ant species richness decreased from 309 to 110 (-64{\%}) between forest and oil palm plantation. However, this impact was not the same across all microhabitats, with bird's nest ferns maintaining almost the same number of ant species in oil palm compared to forest (forest-oil palm, ferns: 36-35 (3{\%} loss), canopy: 120-58 (52{\%} loss), leaf litter: 216-56 (74{\%} loss)). Relative abundance distributions remained the same for fern-dwelling ants, but became less even for oil palm ants in both the canopy and the leaf litter. These differences may be due in part to the ability of bird's nest ferns to provide a stable microclimate in hot, dry plantations. We also found that non-native ant species were more abundant in oil palm than in forest, and few forest ant species survived in plantations in any of the microhabitats. Only 59 of the 309 forest species persisted in oil palm plantations, corresponding to an 81{\%} loss of forest species resulting from habitat conversion. Although oil palm supports many more ant species than has been previously reported, converting forest into plantation still leads to a dramatic reduction in species richness. The maintenance of forested areas is therefore vital for the conservation of ant biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r {\"{O}}kologie.},

@article{Tilman1999,
abstract = {This paper uses theory and experiments to explore the effects of diversity on stability, productivity, and susceptibility to invasion. A model of resource competition predicts that increases in diversity cause com- munity stability to increase, but population stability to decrease. These opposite effects are, to a great extent, explained by how temporal variances in species abundances scale with mean abundance, and by the differential impact of this scaling on population vs. community stability. Community stability also depends on a negative covariance effect (competitive compensation) and on overyielding (ecosystem productivity increasing with diversity). A long-term study in Minnesota grasslands supports these predictions. Models of competition predict, and ﬁeld experiments conﬁrm, that greater plant diversity leads to greater primary productivity. This diversity–productivity relationship results both from the greater chance that a more productive species would be present at higher diversity (the sampling effect) and from the better ‘‘coverage'' of habitat heterogeneity caused by the broader range of species traits in a more diverse community (the niche differentiation effect). Both effects cause more complete utilization of limiting resources at higher diversity, which increases resource retention, further increasing productivity. Finally, lower levels of available limiting resources at higher diversity are predicted to decrease the susceptibility of an ecosystem to invasion, supporting the diversity–invasibility hypothesis. This mechanism provides rules for community assembly and invasion resistance. In total, biodiversity should be added to species composition, disturbance, nutrient supply, and climate as a major controller of population and ecosystem dynamics and structure. By their increasingly great directional impacts on all of these controllers, humans are likely to cause major long-term changes in the functioning of ecosystems worldwide. A better understanding of these ecosystem changes is needed if ecologists are to provide society with the knowledge essential for wise management of the earth and its biological resources.},

An understanding of the mechanistic role of biodiversity is required to provide a functional perspective on ecosystem service delivery. To bridge this gap, investigating complementarity and heterogeneity in functional traits within species groups or across trophic levels is particularly relevant. Such an understanding will then facilitate spatial mapping of areas of co-occurrence of multiple ecosystem services, as well as of critical trade-offs between monetized, cultural and other supporting ecosystem services that need to be considered as hard constraints to ecosystem management. In doing so, the nature and underpinnings of tradeoffs between bundles of ecosystem services accruing to different regions and groups of people, impacting equity and wellbeing, will be uncovered to support improved policy and land planning. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {14 1. The lowland forest of Borneo is threatened by rapid logging for timber export and clearing for the 15 expansion of timber and oil palm plantations. The combination of these two processes leaves behind 16 landscapes dotted with small, often heavily degraded forest fragments. The biodiversity value of 17 such fragments, which are easily dismissed as worthless, is uncertain. 18 2. We collected 187 taxa of staphylinid beetles across a land-use gradient in Sabah, Malaysia, 19 spanning pristine tropical lowland forest to heavily-degraded forest. Using these data, we identified 20 shifts in alpha-, beta-, and gamma-diversity in response to forest quality and forest area, and applied 21 our findings from continuous expanses of forest to make predictions on hypothetical forest 22 fragments. 23 3. We found that maintaining high forest quality is important for conserving rare taxa (those important 24 for conserving biodiversity per se), and that very small fragments (10 ha) are likely to harbour the 25 same richness of staphylinids as larger fragments (100 ha) of the same forest quality. We estimate a 26 decline in staphylinid richness of just 16{\%} following the removal of 90{\%} of the vegetation biomass 27 from a fragment within this area range. 28 4. Maintaining large forest areas is important for conserving common taxa, likely to be more important 29 for conserving ecosystem functioning. Our analyses suggest that 100 ha fragments of heavily-30 degraded forest can support the same or greater diversity of common taxa as 100 ha fragments of 31 pristine forest. We find that reducing 100 ha fragments to 10 ha fragments will likely result in the loss 32 of just 11{\%} of common taxa diversity. 33 5. Despite significant declines in alpha-diversity, beta-diversity within small rainforest fragments will 34 likely partially mitigate the loss of gamma-diversity, reinforcing the concept that beta-diversity is a 35 dominant force determining the conservation of species in fragmented landscapes. 36 6. Synthesis and applications. In contrast to previous findings on larger animals, our results suggest that even small fragments of degraded forest might be important reservoirs of invertebrate biodiversity in tropical agriculture landscapes. These fragments should be conserved where they occur and form an integral part of management for more sustainable agriculture in tropical landscapes.},

abstract = {Aim This study focuses on the influence of methodological choices on the predictive performance of macroecological models (MEMs), i.e. statistical models designed to predict patterns of biodiversity using environmental predictors. We emphasize the influence of three methodological choices: (1) the choice of the currency in which the abundance of each species is measured, i.e. numbers of individuals or biomass; (2) the rules used to define the species assemblage under focus, i.e. broad communities or refined ecological guilds; and (3) the influence of rare over common species in the biodiversity measure. Location The effects of these choices are investigated using an exhaustive dataset on the fish fauna of the continental shelf of the Barents Sea. Methods We conducted an analysis of 220 models resulting from all possible combinations of the three methodological choices. For each, we evaluated the predictive performance through an iterative cross-validation process. Results All methodological choices we investigated strongly affected the predictive performance of MEMs. High predictive performances were obtained when using biomass instead of numbers of individuals, when focusing on narrow ecological guilds composed of species sharing the same ecological traits and when using diversity measures that give high weight to rare species. Main conclusions We recommend that future projections of biodiversity pay more attention to abundance currency, ecological homogeneity of focal species assemblages and the diversity metric used, and systematically investigate these methodological choices prior to producing biodiversity forecasts. Splitting a whole set of species into ecological guilds appears to be a promising practice, leading to a selected set of MEMs with high predictive performances and more detailed forecasts on the fate of diversity.},

abstract = {Biodiversity is a multifaceted concept, yet most biodiversity studies have taken a taxonomic approach, implying that all species are equally important. However, species do not contribute equally to ecosystem processes and differ markedly in their responses to changing environments. This recognition has led to the exploration of other components of biodiversity, notably the diversity of ecologically important traits. Recent studies taking into account both taxonomic and trait diversity have revealed that the two biodiversity components may exhibit pronounced temporal and spatial differences. These apparent incongruences indicate that the two components may respond differently to environmental drivers and that changes in one component might not affect the other. Such incongruences may provide insight into the structuring of communities through community assembly processes, and the resilience of ecosystems to change. Here we examine temporal and spatial patterns and drivers of multiple marine biodiversity indicators using the North Sea fish community as a case study. Based on long-term spatially resolved survey data on fish species occurrences and biomasses from 1983 to 2014 and an extensive trait dataset we: (i) investigate temporal and spatial incongruences between taxonomy and trait-based indicators of both richness and evenness; (ii) examine the underlying environmental drivers and, (iii) interpret the results in the context of assembly rules acting on community composition. Our study shows that taxonomy and trait-based biodiversity indicators differ in time and space and that these differences are correlated to natural and anthropogenic drivers, notably temperature, depth and substrate richness. Our findings show that trait-based biodiversity indicators add information regarding community composition and ecosystem structure compared to and in conjunction with taxonomy-based indicators. These results emphasize the importance of examining and monitoring multiple indicators of biodiversity in ecological studies as well as for conservation and ecosystem-based management purposes.},

To achieve this goal, transformations are proposed for species data tables. They allow ecologists to use ordination methods such as PCA and RDA, which are Euclidean-based, for the analysis of community data, while circumventing the problems associated with the Euclidean distance, and avoiding CA and CCA which present problems of their own in some cases. This allows the use of the original (transformed) species data in RDA carried out to test for relationships with explanatory variables (i.e. environ- $\backslash$nmental variables, or factors of a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model); ecologists can then draw biplots displaying the relationships of the species to the explanatory variables. Another application allows the use of species data in other methods of multivariate data analysis which optimize a least-squares loss function; an example is K-means partitioning.},

The people who are affected and those who provide resources are increasingly asking for evidence that interventions improve ecosystem services and human well-being. New research is needed that considers the full ensemble of processes and feedbacks, for a range of biophysical and social systems, to better understand and manage the dynamics of the relationship between humans and the ecosystems on which they rely.

abstract = {Oil palm is one of the world's most rapidly increasing crops. We assess its contribution to tropical deforestation and review its biodiversity value. Oil palm has replaced large areas of forest in Southeast Asia, but land-cover change statistics alone do not allow an assessment of where it has driven forest clearance and where it has simply followed it. Oil palm plantations support much fewer species than do forests and often also fewer than other tree crops. Further negative impacts include habitat fragmentation and pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions. With rising demand for vegetable oils and biofuels, and strong overlap between areas suitable for oil palm and those of most importance for biodiversity, substantial biodiversity losses will only be averted if future oil palm expansion is managed to avoid deforestation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The diversity-stability hypothesis states that current losses of biodiversity can impair the ability of an ecosystem to dampen the effect of environmental perturbations on its functioning. Using data from a long-term and comprehensive biodiversity experiment, we quantified the temporal stability of 42 variables characterizing twelve ecological functions in managed grassland plots varying in plant species richness. We demonstrate that diversity increases stability i) across trophic levels (producer, consumer), ii) at both the system (community, ecosystem) and the component levels (population, functional group, phylogenetic clade), and iii) primarily for aboveground rather than belowground processes. Temporal synchronization across studied variables was mostly unaffected with increasing species richness. This study provides the strongest empirical support so far that diversity promotes stability across different ecological functions and levels of ecosystem organization in grasslands.},

abstract = {The processes causing the latitudinal gradient in species richness remain elusive. Ecological theories for the origin of biodiversity gradients, such as competitive exclusion, neutral dynamics, and environmental filtering, make predictions for how functional diversity should vary at the alpha (within local assemblages), beta (among assemblages), and gamma (regional pool) scales. We test these predictions by quantifying hypervolumes constructed from functional traits representing major axes of plant strategy variation (specific leaf area, plant height, and seed mass) in tree assemblages spanning the temperate and tropical New World. Alpha-scale trait volume decreases with absolute latitude and is often lower than sampling expectation, consistent with environmental filtering theory. Beta-scale overlap decays with geographic distance fastest in the temperate zone, again consistent with environmental filtering theory. In contrast, gamma-scale trait space shows a hump-shaped relationship with absolute latitude, consistent with no theory. Furthermore, the overall temperate trait hypervolume was larger than the overall tropical hypervolume, indicating that the temperate zone permits a wider range of trait combinations or that niche packing is stronger in the tropical zone. Although there are limitations in the data, our analyses suggest that multiple processes have shaped trait diversity in trees, reflecting no consistent support for any one theory.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {Interactions between biotic and abiotic processes complicate the design and interpretation of ecological experiments. Separating causality from simple correlation requires distinguishing among experimental treatments, experimental responses, and the many processes and properties that are correlated with either the treatments or the responses, or both. When an experimental manipulation has multiple components, but only one of them is identified as the experimental treatment. erroneous conclusions about cause and effect relationships are likely because the actual cause of any observed response may be ignored in the interpretation of the experimental results. This unrecognized cause of an observed response can be considered a ''hidden treatment.'' Three types of hidden treatments are potential problems in biodiversity experiments: (1) abiotic conditions, such as resource levels, or biotic conditions, such as predation, which are intentionally or unintentionally altered in order to create differences in species numbers for ''diversity'' treatments; (2) non-random selection of species with particular attributes that produce treatment differences that exceed those due to ''diversity'' alone; and (3) the increased statistical probability of including a species with a dominant negative or positive effect (e.g., dense shade, or nitrogen fixation) in randomly selected groups of species of increasing number or ''diversity.'' In each of these cases, treatment responses that are actually the result of the ''hidden treatment'' may be inadvertently attributed to variation in species diversity. Case studies re-evaluating three different types of biodiversity experiments demonstrate that the increases found in such ecosystem properties as productivity, nutrient use efficiency, and stability (all of which were attributed to higher levels of species diversity) were actually caused by ''hidden trearments'' that altered plant biomass and productivity.},

abstract = {To clarify the causes and history of forest loss in Indonesia from 1950 to 2015, we compiled and analyzed national-level statistics and literature relating to forest cover change. In 1950, nearly 159.0 Mha (87.0{\%}) of the total land area (182.7 million hectares or Mha) in Indonesia was estimated to be covered by forest. Between 1950 and 1997, 59.0 Mha of forest was deforested, while 7.1 Mha of arable land, 10.2 Mha of permanent crop, and 41.7 Mha of "other" land category were increased. Between 1997 and 2015, 5.6 Mha of arable land and 11.3 Mha of land for permanent crop were increased, while 9.0 Mha of forest and 7.9 Mha of the "other" category decreased. Prior to 1970, no trend of severe forest loss was apparent. Between 1970 and the mid-1990s, export-oriented log production and global demand were the primary pressures underlying deforestation. Cultivation of rice and other crops was also found to be associated with a growing population and transmigration policy. Moreover, deregulation of foreign investment in the 1980s appears to have led to expansion of an export-oriented industry, including commercial crop and log production. Between the mid-1990s and 2015, imbalance between global demand and production of Indonesian timber and oil palm led to illegal or non-sustainable timber harvest and expansion of permanent agricultural areas. Since 2011, regulation of forestry practices coupled with a tree planting movement have been promoted, resulting in the amelioration of deforestation rates.},

abstract = {Understanding how and why certain clades diversify greatly in morphology whereas others do not remains a major theme in evolutionary biology. Projecting families of phylogenies into multivariate morphospaces can distinguish two scenarios potentially leading to unequal morphological diversification: unequal magnitude of change per phylogenetic branch, and unequal efficiency in morphological innovation. This approach is demonstrated using a case study of skulls in sister clades within the South American fish superfamily Anostomoidea. Unequal morphological diversification in this system resulted not from the morphologically diverse clade changing more on each phylogenetic branch, but from that clade distributing an equal amount of change more widely through morphospace and innovating continually. Although substantial morphological evolution occurred throughout the less diverse clade's history, most of that clade's expansion in morphospace occurred in the most basal branches, and more derived portions of that radiation oscillated within previously explored limits. Because simulations revealed that there is a maximum 2.7{\%} probability of generating two clades that differ so greatly in the density of lineages within morphospace under a null Brownian model, the observed difference in pattern likely reflects a difference in the underlying evolutionary process. Clade-specific factors that may have promoted or arrested morphological diversification are discussed.},

Estimating hypervolumes from sampled data has been an ongoing challenge due to conceptual and computational issues. 2.

The methods produce smooth boundaries that can fit data either more loosely (Gaussian kernel density estimation) or more tightly (one-classification via support vector machine). Further, the algorithms can accept abundance-weighted data, and the resulting hypervolumes can be given a probabil- istic interpretation and projected into geographic space. 3. We demonstrate the properties of these methods on a large dataset that character- ises the functional traits and geographic distribution of thousands of plants. The methods are available in version ≥2.0.7 of the HYPERVOLUME R package. 4.

abstract = {A recent debate among ecologists has focused on mechanisms by which species diversity might affect net primary productivity. Communities with more species could use a greater variety of resource capture characteristics, leading to greater use of limiting resources (complementarity) and therefore greater productivity (overyielding). Recent experiments, however, have shown a variety of relationships between diversity and productivity. In an experiment on serpentine grassland communities spanning 8 years, we found that overyielding increased several years after plot establishment. Overyielding varied greatly depending on the functional characteristics of the species involved and the biotic and abiotic environment (particularly water availability). While functional differences among species led to strong complementarity and facilitation, these effects were not sufficient to cause significant transgressive overyielding or consistent increases in productivity with increased plant diversity. These results suggest that greater absolute production with greater diversity may be restricted to particular species combinations or environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Summary Despite extensive development of successional theory, few empirical studies have evaluated whether existing models are applicable to human-modified landscapes. Seasonally dry tropical forests are experiencing widespread transformation, and represent a critical system to assess in a successional framework to infer the mechanisms that shape assembly of secondary forests post-management. We used a functional trait-based approach to assess changes in community assembly mechanisms along a successional gradient in secondary dry forests of varying stages following abandonment of cattle activity. Nearby old-growth forests served as an undisturbed comparison. We evaluated whether re-assembly proceeded consistent with existing theory, in early successional stages via habitat filtering, leading to reduced trait range, and via competitive exclusion in later stages, leading to increased trait evenness. Using three orthogonal traits and two functional diversity indices we tested for evidence of assembly mechanisms along resource axes that may be particularly important to dry forest systems, dynamic changes in habitat filtering and competitive exclusion, and potential legacy effects of management. We found little support of a progression from habitat filtering to competitive exclusion, with the exception of dispersion patterns for specific leaf area and multi-variate functional richness. Water availability may underlie species sorting in most stages, as evidenced by range reduction in wood density, and might be a resource particularly important to dry forest assembly. Early successional stages displayed an unexpected pattern of low evenness, which may be due to initial stand composition including remnants and resprouts, a regeneration strategy typical to dry forest species. Beyond influencing initial conditions, management legacy was apparent in advanced secondary forests, which differed in range, even dispersion, and functional richness from old-growth forests, suggesting the operation of different assembly mechanisms. The departures from expectations suggest the need to re-assess successional models to include effects of management legacies on the operation of community assembly mechanisms in human-modified landscapes, as well as characteristics that distinguish wet and dry forest dynamics.},

Here, we develop a theory that predicts the temporal variability of community biomass from the properties of individual component species in monoculture. Our theory shows that biodiversity stabilises ecosystems through three main mechanisms: (1) asynchrony in species' responses to environmental fluctuations, (2) reduced demographic stochasticity due to overyielding in species mixtures and (3) reduced observation error (including spatial and sampling variability). Parameterised with empirical data from four long-term grassland biodiversity experiments, our prediction explained 22–75{\%} of the observed variability, and captured much of the effect of species richness. Richness stabilised communities mainly by increasing community biomass and reducing the strength of demographic stochasticity.

abstract = {Ecology and geomorphology recognize the dynamic aspects of resistance and resilience. However, formal resilience theory in ecology has tended to deemphasize the geomorphic habitat template. Conversely, landscape sensitivity and state-and-transition models in geomorphology downweight mechanisms of biotic adaptation operative in fluctuating, spatially explicit environments. Adding to the interdisciplinary challenge of understanding complex biogeomorphic systems is that environmental heterogeneity and overlapping gradients of disturbance complicate inference of the geographic patterns of resistance and resilience. We develop a conceptual model for comparing the resilience properties among barrier dunes. The model illustrates how adaptive cycles and panarchies, the formal building blocks of resilience recognized in ecology, can be expressed as a set of hierarchically nested geomorphic and ecological metrics. The variance structure of these data is proposed as a means to delineate different kinds and levels of resilience. Specifically, it is the dimensionality of these data and how geomorphic and ecological variables load on the first and succeeding axes that facilitates the delineation of resistance and resilience. The construction of dune topographic state space from observations among different barrier islands is proposed as a way to measure the interdependence of geomorphic and ecological resilience properties.},

abstract = {South East Asia has the highest rate of lowland forest loss of any tropical region, with logging and deforestation for conversion to plantation agriculture being flagged as the most urgent threats. Detecting and mapping logging impacts on forest structure is a primary conservation concern, as these impacts feed through to changes in biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Here, we test whether high-spatial resolution satellite remote sensing can be used to map the responses of aboveground live tree biomass (AGB), canopy leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (FCover) to selective logging and deforestation in Malaysian Borneo. We measured these attributes in permanent vegetation plots in rainforest and oil palm plantations across the degradation landscape of the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems project. We found significant mathematical relationships between field-measured structure and satellite-derived spectral and texture information, explaining up to 62{\%} of variation in biophysical structure across forest and oil palm plots. These relationships held at different aggregation levels from plots to forest disturbance types and oil palms allowing us to map aboveground biomass and canopy structure across the degradation landscape. The maps reveal considerable spatial variation in the impacts of previous logging, a pattern that was less clear when considering field data alone. Up-scaled maps revealed a pronounced decline in aboveground live tree biomass with increasing disturbance, impacts which are also clearly visible in the field data even a decade after logging. Field data demonstrate a rapid recovery in forest canopy structure with the canopy recovering to pre-disturbance levels a decade after logging. Yet, up-scaled maps show that both LAI and FCover are still reduced in logged compared to primary forest stands and markedly lower in oil palm stands. While uncertainties remain, these maps can now be utilised to identify conservation win-wins, especially when combining them with ongoing biodiversity surveys and measurements of carbon sequestration, hydrological cycles and microclimate.},

abstract = {Oil palm cultivation is frequently cited as a major threat to tropical biodiversity as it is centered on some of the world's most biodiverse regions. In this report, Web of Science was used to find papers on oil palm published since 1970, which were assigned to different subject categories to visualize their research focus. Recent years have seen a broadening in the scope of research, with a slight growth in publications on the environment and a dramatic increase in those on biofuel. Despite this, less than 1{\%} of publications are related to biodiversity and species conservation. In the context of global vegetable oil markets, palm oil and soyabean account for over 60{\%} of production but are the subject of less than 10{\%} of research. Much more work must be done to establish the impacts of habitat conversion to oil palm plantation on biodiversity. Results from such studies are crucial for informing conservation strategies and ensuring sustainable management of plantations.},

@article{Tilman2006,
abstract = {Human-driven ecosystem simplification has highlighted questions about how the number of species in an ecosystem influences its functioning. Although biodiversity is now known to affect ecosystem productivity, its effects on stability are debated. Here we present a long-term experimental field test of the diversity-stability hypothesis. During a decade of data collection in an experiment that directly controlled the number of perennial prairie species, growing-season climate varied considerably, causing year-to-year variation in abundances of plant species and in ecosystem productivity. We found that greater numbers of plant species led to greater temporal stability of ecosystem annual aboveground plant production. In particular, the decadal temporal stability of the ecosystem, whether measured with intervals of two, five or ten years, was significantly greater at higher plant diversity and tended to increase as plots matured. Ecosystem stability was also positively dependent on root mass, which is a measure of perenniating biomass. Temporal stability of the ecosystem increased with diversity, despite a lower temporal stability of individual species, because of both portfolio (statistical averaging) and overyielding effects. However, we found no evidence of a covariance effect. Our results indicate that the reliable, efficient and sustainable supply of some foods (for example, livestock fodder), biofuels and ecosystem services can be enhanced by the use of biodiversity.},

@article{Lehman2000,
abstract = {Three markedly different models of multispecies competition- one mechanistic, one phenomenological, and one statistical- all predict that greater diversity increases the temporal stability of the entire community, decreases the temporal stability of individual populations, and increases community productivity. We define temporal stability as the ratio of mean abundance to its standard deviation. Interestingly, the temporal stability of entire communities is predicted to increase fairly linearly, without clear saturation, as diversity increases. Species composition is predicted to be as important as diversity in affecting community stability and productivity. The greater temporal stability of more diverse communities is causedby higher productivity at higher diversity (the "overyielding" effect), competitive interactions (the "covariance" effect), and statistical averaging (the "portfolio" effect). The relative contribution of each cause of temporal stability changes as diversity increases, but the net effect is that greater diversity stabilizes the community even though it destabilizes individual populations. This theory agrees with recent experiments and provides a degree of resolution to the diversitystabilitydebate: both sides of the longstanding debate were correct, but one addressed population stability and the other addressed community stability},

abstract = {Human-driven land-use changes increasingly threaten biodiversity, particularly in tropical forests where both species diversity and human pressures on natural environments are high(1). The rapid conversion of tropical forests for agriculture, timber production and other uses has generated vast, human-dominated landscapes with potentially dire consequences for tropical biodiversity(2-5). Today, few truly undisturbed tropical forests exist, whereas those degraded by repeated logging and fires, as well as secondary and plantation forests, are rapidly expanding(6,7). Here we provide a global assessment of the impact of disturbance and land conversion on biodiversity in tropical forests using a meta-analysis of 138 studies. We analysed 2,220 pairwise comparisons of biodiversity values in primary forests (with little or no human disturbance) and disturbed forests. We found that biodiversity values were substantially lower in degraded forests, but that this varied considerably by geographic region, taxonomic group, ecological metric and disturbance type. Even after partly accounting for confounding colonization and succession effects due to the composition of surrounding habitats, isolation and time since disturbance, we find that most forms of forest degradation have an overwhelmingly detrimental effect on tropical biodiversity. Our results clearly indicate that when it comes to maintaining tropical biodiversity, there is no substitute for primary forests.},

abstract = {Tropical Southeast Asia harbors extraordinary species richness and in its entirety comprises four of the Earth's 34 biodiversity hotspots. Here, we examine the assembly of the Southeast Asian biota through time and space. We conduct meta-analyses of geological, climatic and biological (including 61 phylogenetic) datasets to test which areas have been the sources of long-term biological diversity in SE Asia, particularly in the pre-Miocene, Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene, and whether the respective biota have been dominated by in situ diversification, immigration and/or emigration, or equilibrium dynamics. We identify Borneo and Indochina, in particular, as major  evolutionary hotspots' for a diverse range of fauna and flora. While most of the region's biodiversity is a result of both the accumulation of immigrants and in situ diversification, within-area diversification and subsequent emigration have been the predominant signals characterizing Indochina and Borneo's biota since at least the early Miocene. In contrast, colonization events are comparatively rare from younger volcanically active emergent islands such as Java, which show increased levels of immigration events. Few dispersal events were observed across the major biogeographic barrier of Wallace's Line. Accelerated efforts to conserve Borneo's flora and fauna in particular, currently housing the highest levels of Southeast Asian plant and mammal species richness, are critically required.},

abstract = {We integrate climatic niche models and dated phylogenies to characterize the evolution of climatic niches in Oenothera sections Anogra and Kleinia (Onagraceae), and from that we make inferences on diversification in relation to climate. The evolution of climatic tolerances in Anogra + Kleinia has been heterogeneous, across phylogenetic groups and across different dimensions of climate. All the extant taxa occur in semiarid to arid conditions (annual precipitation of 10.1-49.1 cm and high temperatures in the warmest month of 28.5 degrees-40.1 degrees C), but there is striking variation among taxa in their climatic tolerances, especially temperature (minimum temperatures in the coldest month of -14.0 degrees to 5.3 degrees C) and summer versus winter precipitation (precipitation in the warmest quarter of 0.6-19.4 cm). Climatic disparity is especially pronounced in two subclades (californica, deltoides) that radiated in the southwestern United States and California, apparently including both divergent and convergent evolution of climatic tolerances. This niche evolution is remarkable, given the probable timescale of the radiation (approximately 1 million years). We suggest that the spatiotemporal climatic heterogeneity of western North America has served as a driver of diversification. Our data are also consistent with Axelrod's hypothesis that the spread of arid conditions in western North America stimulated diversification of arid-adapted lineages.},

abstract = {Understanding the relationship between diversity and stability requires a knowledge of how species interact with each other and how each is affected by the environment. The relationship is also complex, because the concept of stability is multifaceted; different types of stability describing different properties of ecosystems lead to multiple diversity-stability relationships. A growing number of empirical studies demonstrate positive diversity-stability relationships. These studies, however, have emphasized only a few types of stability, and they rarely uncover the mechanisms responsible for stability. Because anthropogenic changes often affect stability and diversity simultaneously, diversity-stability relationships cannot be understood outside the context of the environmental drivers affecting both. This shifts attention away from diversity-stability relationships toward the multiple factors, including diversity, that dictate the stability of ecosystems.},

abstract = {Malaria cases caused by Plasmodium knowlesi, a simian parasite naturally found in long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques, are increasing rapidly in Sabah, Malaysia. One hypothesis is that this increase is associated with changes in land use. A study was carried out to identify the anopheline vectors present in different forest types and to observe the human landing behaviour of mosquitoes. Mosquito collections were carried out using human landing catches at ground and canopy levels in the Tawau Division of Sabah. Collections were conducted along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient (primary forest, lightly logged virgin jungle reserve and salvage logged forest) between 18:00 and 22:00 h. $\backslash$n                           Anopheles balabacensis, a vector of P. knowlesi, was the predominant species in all collection areas, accounting for 70 {\%} of the total catch, with a peak landing time of 18:30–20:00 h. Anopheles balabacensis had a preference for landing on humans at ground level compared to the canopy (p {\textless} 0.0001). A greater abundance of mosquitoes were landing in the logged forest compared to the primary forest (p {\textless} 0.0001). There was no difference between mosquito abundance in the logged forest and lightly logged forest (p = 0.554). A higher evening temperature (p {\textless} 0.0001) and rainfall (p {\textless} 0.0001) significantly decreased mosquito abundance during collection nights. This study demonstrates the potential ability of An. balabacensis to transmit P. knowlesi between canopy-dwelling simian hosts and ground-dwelling humans, and that forest disturbance increases the abundance of this disease vector. These results, in combination with regional patterns of land use change, may partly explain the rapid rise in P. knowlesi cases in Sabah. This study provides essential data on anthropophily for the principal vector of P. knowlesi which is important for the planning of vector control strategies.},

Few studies, however, have explored the effect of climate change on ecological stability and the underlying mechanisms. We conduct a field experiment to assess the influence of warming and altered precipitation on the temporal stability of plant community biomass in an alpine grassland located on the Tibetan Plateau. We find that whereas precipitation alteration does not influence biomass temporal stability, warming lowers stability through reducing the degree of species asynchrony. Importantly, biomass temporal stability is not influenced by plant species diversity, but is largely determined by the temporal stability of dominant species and asynchronous population dynamics among the coexisting species. Our findings suggest that ongoing and future climate change may alter stability properties of ecological communities, potentially hindering their ability to provide ecosystem services for humanity.},

abstract = {Although the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning has become a major focus in ecology, its significance in a fluctuating environment is still poorly understood. According to the insurance hypothesis, biodiversity insures ecosystems against declines in their functioning because many species provide greater guarantees that some will maintain functioning even if others fail. Here we examine this hypothesis theoretically. We develop a general stochastic dynamic model to assess the effects of species richness on the expected temporal mean and variance of ecosystem processes such as productivity, based on individual species' productivity responses to environmental fluctuations. Our model shows two major insurance effects of species richness on ecosystem productivity: (i) a buffering effect, i.e., a reduction in the temporal variance of productivity, and (ii) a performance-enhancing effect, i.e., an increase in the temporal mean of productivity. The strength of these insurance effects is determined by three factors: (i) the way ecosystem productivity is determined by individual species responses to environmental fluctuations, (ii) the degree of asynchronicity of these responses, and (iii) the detailed form of these responses. In particular, the greater the variance of the species responses, the lower the species richness at which the temporal mean of the ecosystem process saturates and the ecosystem becomes redundant. These results provide a strong theoretical foundation for the insurance hypothesis, which proves to be a fundamental principle for understanding the long-term effects of biodiversity on ecosystem processes.},

Ecological hypotheses about how these species continue to coexist are often cast into equilibrium or non-equilibrium frameworks: Do tropical forests comprise " . . . sets of highly coevolved niche-differentiated tree species in stable or semi- stable floristic assemblages," or do they consist of " . . . diffusely coevolved, broadly generalist species which slowly drift in relative abundance within a few large life-history guilds" (67, 102)? In this context, there has been considerable recent interest in the role of adaptations by species to different regeneration sites in structuring plant assemblages in general (83, 84, 86, 141), and tropical tree communities in particular (62, 89, 90, 150). The immediacy of this interest is heightened by rising rates of deforestation throughout the tropics and a critical need for management strategies of the remaining preserves, for ecologically sound harvesting procedures, and for the tools with which to restore degraded forests. Openings in the forest canopy are widely recognized as important for the establishment and growth of rainforest trees (5, 33, 62, 90). Hartshorn (89) suggests that perhaps 75{\%} of the tree species at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica are dependent on canopy opening for seed germination or for growth beyond sapling size. Similar statements are found in descriptions of forest dynamics in Queensland, Australia (185), Malaysian dipterocarp for- ests (195), and West African rain forest (108). Demographic},

abstract = {Species diversity is thought to stabilize functioning of plant communities. An alternative view is that stability depends more on dynamics of dominant species than on diversity. We compared inter-annual variability (inverse of stability) of aboveground biomass in paired restored and remnant tallgrass prairies at two locations in central Texas, USA. Data from these two locations were used to test the hypothesis that greater richness and evenness in remnant than restored prairies would reduce variability in aboveground biomass in response to natural variation in rainfall. Restored prairies were chosen to be similar to paired remnant prairies in characteristics other than species diversity that affect temporal variability in biomass. Variability was measured as the coefficient of variation among years (square root of variance/mean; CV), where variance in community biomass equals the sum of variances of individual plant species plus the summed covariances between species pairs. Species diversity over five years was greater by a factor of 2 or more in remnant than restored prairies because richness and evenness were greater in remnant than restored prairies. Still, the CV of community biomass during spring and CV of annual biomass production did not differ consistently between prairie types. Neither the sum of species covariances nor total community biomass differed between prairies. Biomass varied relatively little in restored compared to remnant prairies because biomass of the dominant species in restored prairies (the grass Schizachyrium scoparium) varied less than did biomass of other dominant and sub-dominant species. In these grasslands, biomass response to natural variation in precipitation depended as much on characteristics of a dominant grass as on differences in diversity.},

abstract = {Forest fragmentation and selective logging are two main drivers of global environmental change and modify biodiversity and environmental conditions in many tropical forests. The consequences of these changes for the functioning of tropical forest ecosystems have rarely been explored in a comprehensive approach. In a Kenyan rainforest, we studied six animal-mediated ecosystem processes and recorded species richness and community composition of all animal taxa involved in these processes. We used linear models and a formal meta-analysis to test whether forest fragmentation and selective logging affected ecosystem processes and biodiversity and used structural equation models to disentangle direct from biodiversity-related indirect effects of human disturbance on multiple ecosystem processes. Fragmentation increased decomposition and reduced antbird predation, while selective logging consistently increased pollination, seed dispersal and army-ant raiding. Fragmentation modified species richness or community composition of five taxa, whereas selective logging did not affect any component of biodiversity. Changes in the abundance of functionally important species were related to lower predation by antbirds and higher decomposition rates in small forest fragments. The positive effects of selective logging on bee pollination, bird seed dispersal and army-ant raiding were direct, i.e. not related to changes in biodiversity, and were probably due to behavioural changes of these highly mobile animal taxa. We conclude that animal-mediated ecosystem processes respond in distinct ways to different types of human disturbance in Kakamega Forest. Our findings suggest that forest fragmentation affects ecosystem processes indirectly by changes in biodiversity, whereas selective logging influences processes directly by modifying local environmental conditions and resource distributions. The positive to neutral effects of selective logging on ecosystem processes show that the functionality of tropical forests can be maintained in moderately disturbed forest fragments. Conservation concepts for tropical forests should thus include not only remaining pristine forests but also functionally viable forest remnants.},

abstract = {With growing global demands for palm oil, there is mounting pressure on limited natural resources to support the dual services of agricultural productivity and maintenance of biodiversity. Balancing these two services requires detailed research on four themes: i) the impacts on biodiversity of forest conversion and fragmentation, ii) which factors drive these changes in biological communities, iii) what impacts changes have on ecosystem functioning and, iv) the management and design of multifunctional landscapes. Such questions are often difficult to answer as data must be collected at the landscape scale and over long time periods. The Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems (SAFE) Project (see www.safeproject.net for more details) is a ground-breaking scientific study based in Sabah, Malaysia which investigates the impacts of forest conversion to oil palm on biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and productivity. Funded by the Sime Darby Foundation with support from Benta Wawasan and the Sabah Forestry Department, the project is a collaboration between research institutions and the oil palm industry. The project takes advantage of a 7 900 ha area of forest which was scheduled for conversion to oil palm in 2012, allowing the consequences of habitat conversion to be directly measured. Now at the beginning of its third year, the SAFE Project is already yielding results of direct relevance to tropical conservation and plantation management. As well as a core team of nearly thirty researchers and research assistants working full-time on the project, SAFE has also provided a platform for collaborative scientists studying a wide range of taxa and ecosystem functions. To date over 90 researchers from 23 different institutions have been involved with research projects in the SAFE area. The SAFE Project provides a good example of the benefits of closer collaboration between stakeholders in the development of conservation initiatives and a more sustainable palm oil industry.},

abstract = {Concern is growing about the consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem functioning, for the provision of ecosystem services, and for human well being. Experimental evidence for a relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem process rates is compelling, but the issue remains contentious. Here, we present the first rigorous quantitative assessment of this relationship through meta-analysis of experimental work spanning 50 years to June 2004. We analysed 446 measures of biodiversity effects (252 in grasslands), 319 of which involved primary producer manipulations or measurements. Our analyses show that: biodiversity effects are weaker if biodiversity manipulations are less well controlled; effects of biodiversity change on processes are weaker at the ecosystem compared with the community level and are negative at the population level; productivity-related effects decline with increasing number of trophic links between those elements manipulated and those measured; biodiversity effects on stability measures ('insurance' effects) are not stronger than biodiversity effects on performance measures. For those ecosystem services which could be assessed here, there is clear evidence that biodiversity has positive effects on most. Whilst such patterns should be further confirmed, a precautionary approach to biodiversity management would seem prudent in the meantime.},

abstract = {Increasing frequency of extreme climate events is likely to impose increased stress on ecosystems and to jeopardize the services that ecosystems provide. Therefore, it is of major importance to assess the effects of extreme climate events on the temporal stability (i.e., the resistance, the resilience, and the variance) of ecosystem properties. Most time series of ecosystem properties are, however, affected by varying data characteristics, uncertainties, and noise, which complicate the comparison of ecosystem stability metrics (ESMs) between locations. Therefore, there is a strong need for a more comprehensive understanding regarding the reliability of stability metrics and how they can be used to compare ecosystem stability globally. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of temporal ESMs based on time series of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index of 15 global land-cover types. We provide a framework (i) to assess the reliability of ESMs in function of data characteristics, uncertainties and noise and (ii) to integrate reliability estimates in future global ecosystem stability studies against climate disturbances. The performance of our framework was tested through (i) a global ecosystem comparison and (ii) an comparison of ecosystem stability in response to the 2003 drought. The results show the influence of data quality on the accuracy of ecosystem stability. White noise, biased noise, and trends have a stronger effect on the accuracy of stability metrics than the length of the time series, temporal resolution, or amount of missing values. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of integrating reliability estimates to interpret stability metrics within confidence limits. Based on these confidence limits, other studies dealing with specific ecosystem types or locations can be put into context, and a more reliable assessment of ecosystem stability against environmental disturbances can be obtained.},

We used virtual experiments based on a dynamic simulation model to test for the diversity-stability relationship and its underlying mechanisms in Central European forests. First our results show that variability in productivity between stands differing in species composition decreases as species richness and functional diversity increase. Second we show temporal stability increases with increasing diversity due to compensatory dynamics across species, supporting the biodiversity insurance hypothesis. We demonstrate that this pattern is mainly driven by the asynchrony of species responses to small disturbances rather than to environmental fluctuations, and is only weakly affected by the net biodiversity effect on productivity. Furthermore, our results suggest that compensatory dynamics between species may enhance ecosystem stability through an optimisation of canopy occupancy by coexisting species.},

Hence, we propose a framework that takes advantage of the multiplicity of components of an ecosystem and their contribution to stability. Ecosystem components can range from species or functional groups, to different functional traits, or even the cover of different habitats in a landscape mosaic. We make use of n-dimensional hypervolumes to define ecosystem states and assess how much they shift after environmental changes have occurred. We demonstrate the value of this framework with a study case on the effects of environmental change on Alpine ecosystems. Our results highlight the importance of a multidimensional approach when studying ecosystem stability and show that our framework is flexible enough to be applied to different types of ecosystem components, which can have impor- tant implications for the study of ecosystem stability and transient dynamics.},

Understanding how land use change affects the very processes underpinning ecosystem function is understudied, yet plays a key role in biodiversity conservation. This study used exclosure experiments to quantify the roles played by vertebrates and invertebrates in secondary seed removal, at a site in Northern Borneo. Transects were laid out in unlogged primary forest, twice logged secondary forest and oil palm plantation, all as part of the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems project, a large ecological project examining the effects of fragmentation and conversion to monocultural agriculture on forests in Malaysia. The relationship between rates of seed removal and forest quality were investigated. Invertebrates were found to dominate seed removal across all habitats and forest quality levels, with significantly increased vertebrate seed removal in highly degraded forest, which is thought to be linked to higher ground vegetation in these microhabitats. Although seed size and chemistry must play an important role, it appears that invertebrates play a key role in secondary seed predation and dispersal beyond what was assumed for South-East Asian forests.},

abstract = {Invertebrates are dominant species in primary tropical rainforests, where their abundance and diversity contributes to the functioning and resilience of these globally important ecosystems. However, more than one-third of tropical forests have been logged, with dramatic impacts on rainforest biodiversity that may disrupt key ecosystem processes. We find that the contribution of invertebrates to three ecosystem processes operating at three trophic levels (litter decomposition, seed predation and removal, and invertebrate predation) is reduced by up to one-half following logging. These changes are associated with decreased abundance of key functional groups of termites, ants, beetles and earthworms, and an increase in the abundance of small mammals, amphibians and insectivorous birds in logged relative to primary forest. Our results suggest that ecosystem processes themselves have considerable resilience to logging, but the consistent decline of invertebrate functional importance is indicative of a human-induced shift in how these ecological processes operate in tropical rainforests.},

@article{Qiao2017,
abstract = {Recently, we noted (Qiao, Escobar, Saupe, Ji, {\&} Soberon, 2016) that multivariate kernel density estimation (KDE) may not outperform other methods for estimating hypervolume geometries and, moreover, under certain circumstances the algorithm would not detect ‘holes' in environmental space, as Blonder, Lamanna, Violle, and Enquist (2014) had proposed. In our original note (Qiao et al., 2016), we explained that KDE (a) is sensitive to both sample size and environmental dimensionality, (b) may overestimate niche volumes in low dimensions and constrict niche volume estimates in high dimensions, and (c) is useful only to the extent that the realized niche is sought and not the fundamental niche. Here, we also note that bandwidth is a crucial parameter for KDE, and its selection needs to be evaluated rigorously and all assumptions stated clearly. In their response to our comments, Blonder et al. (2017) indicated that (a) KDE output depends in useful ways on dataset size and bias, (b) other species distribution modelling methods make equally stringent but different assumptions about dataset bias, (c) we made an incorrect data transformation in our original experiments that may result in unfair comparisons, and (d) hypervolume methods are more general than KDE and have other benefits for niche modelling. We address these points below, which we divide into two main categories: methodological concerns and theoretical concerns.},

@article{Biswas2011,
abstract = {The relationship between species diversity and functional diversity is a fundamental topic in conservation ecology but its direct evaluation in naturally heterogeneous systems and its relationship with disturbance intensity is limited. We examined the relationship between taxonomy-based species diversity (in terms of richness and evenness) and trait-based functional diversity of riparian and upland vegetation and determined if the slopes of this relationship vary with disturbance intensity. We used data from riparian and upland plant communities subjected to three categorical disturbance intensities (low¼uncut mature forests, intermediate¼riparian buffers around clearcuts and riparian buffers around clearcutsþsoil scarification, and high¼clearcuts and clearcutsþsoil scarification) along 24 small streams of boreal forests in northwestern Ontario, Canada. For all disturbance intensities and habitat types (riparian vs. upland), the relationships between species diversity and functional diversity were positive and non-zero, but the slopes of these relationships varied significantly with disturbance intensities. In species richness vs. functional richness relationship, the slopes were steep at low and high disturbances and relatively less steep at moderate disturbance; however, patterns were less clear in species evenness vs. functional evenness relationship. Differential distributions of species richness per trait were, in part, associated with this variation in slope. In richness (opposite for evenness), less steep slopes were associated with relatively uniform distribution of species richness per trait compared to non-uniform distribution at steep slopes, where competitive (low disturbance) and disturbance-tolerant (high disturbance) traits dominated. Our results confirm that species diversity is a good indicator of ecosystem stability but it depends on ecosystem disturbance history. More importantly, this study suggests that different components of species diversity (e.g., richness and evenness) and the distribution of species richness per trait together can summarize the stability of an ecosystem more accurately than prediction made from species diversity alone.},
