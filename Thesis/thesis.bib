abstract = {Ecology and geomorphology recognize the dynamic aspects of resistance and resilience. However, formal resilience theory in ecology has tended to deemphasize the geomorphic habitat template. Conversely, landscape sensitivity and state-and-transition models in geomorphology downweight mechanisms of biotic adaptation operative in fluctuating, spatially explicit environments. Adding to the interdisciplinary challenge of understanding complex biogeomorphic systems is that environmental heterogeneity and overlapping gradients of disturbance complicate inference of the geographic patterns of resistance and resilience. We develop a conceptual model for comparing the resilience properties among barrier dunes. The model illustrates how adaptive cycles and panarchies, the formal building blocks of resilience recognized in ecology, can be expressed as a set of hierarchically nested geomorphic and ecological metrics. The variance structure of these data is proposed as a means to delineate different kinds and levels of resilience. Specifically, it is the dimensionality of these data and how geomorphic and ecological variables load on the first and succeeding axes that facilitates the delineation of resistance and resilience. The construction of dune topographic state space from observations among different barrier islands is proposed as a way to measure the interdependence of geomorphic and ecological resilience properties.},

abstract = {South East Asia has the highest rate of lowland forest loss of any tropical region, with logging and deforestation for conversion to plantation agriculture being flagged as the most urgent threats. Detecting and mapping logging impacts on forest structure is a primary conservation concern, as these impacts feed through to changes in biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Here, we test whether high-spatial resolution satellite remote sensing can be used to map the responses of aboveground live tree biomass (AGB), canopy leaf area index (LAI) and fractional vegetation cover (FCover) to selective logging and deforestation in Malaysian Borneo. We measured these attributes in permanent vegetation plots in rainforest and oil palm plantations across the degradation landscape of the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems project. We found significant mathematical relationships between field-measured structure and satellite-derived spectral and texture information, explaining up to 62{\%} of variation in biophysical structure across forest and oil palm plots. These relationships held at different aggregation levels from plots to forest disturbance types and oil palms allowing us to map aboveground biomass and canopy structure across the degradation landscape. The maps reveal considerable spatial variation in the impacts of previous logging, a pattern that was less clear when considering field data alone. Up-scaled maps revealed a pronounced decline in aboveground live tree biomass with increasing disturbance, impacts which are also clearly visible in the field data even a decade after logging. Field data demonstrate a rapid recovery in forest canopy structure with the canopy recovering to pre-disturbance levels a decade after logging. Yet, up-scaled maps show that both LAI and FCover are still reduced in logged compared to primary forest stands and markedly lower in oil palm stands. While uncertainties remain, these maps can now be utilised to identify conservation win-wins, especially when combining them with ongoing biodiversity surveys and measurements of carbon sequestration, hydrological cycles and microclimate.},

abstract = {As biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, an important current scientific challenge is to understand and predict the consequences of biodiversity loss. Here, we develop a theory that predicts the temporal variability of community biomass from the properties of individual component species in monoculture. Our theory shows that biodiversity stabilises ecosystems through three main mechanisms: (1) asynchrony in species' responses to environmental fluctuations, (2) reduced demographic stochasticity due to overyielding in species mixtures and (3) reduced observation error (including spatial and sampling variability). Parameterised with empirical data from four long-term grassland biodiversity experiments, our prediction explained 22–75{\%} of the observed variability, and captured much of the effect of species richness. Richness stabilised communities mainly by increasing community biomass and reducing the strength of demographic stochasticity. Our approach calls for a re-evaluation of the mechanisms explaining the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem stability.},

abstract = {With growing global demands for palm oil, there is mounting pressure on limited natural resources to support the dual services of agricultural productivity and maintenance of biodiversity. Balancing these two services requires detailed research on four themes: i) the impacts on biodiversity of forest conversion and fragmentation, ii) which factors drive these changes in biological communities, iii) what impacts changes have on ecosystem functioning and, iv) the management and design of multifunctional landscapes. Such questions are often difficult to answer as data must be collected at the landscape scale and over long time periods. The Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems (SAFE) Project (see www.safeproject.net for more details) is a ground-breaking scientific study based in Sabah, Malaysia which investigates the impacts of forest conversion to oil palm on biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and productivity. Funded by the Sime Darby Foundation with support from Benta Wawasan and the Sabah Forestry Department, the project is a collaboration between research institutions and the oil palm industry. The project takes advantage of a 7 900 ha area of forest which was scheduled for conversion to oil palm in 2012, allowing the consequences of habitat conversion to be directly measured. Now at the beginning of its third year, the SAFE Project is already yielding results of direct relevance to tropical conservation and plantation management. As well as a core team of nearly thirty researchers and research assistants working full-time on the project, SAFE has also provided a platform for collaborative scientists studying a wide range of taxa and ecosystem functions. To date over 90 researchers from 23 different institutions have been involved with research projects in the SAFE area. The SAFE Project provides a good example of the benefits of closer collaboration between stakeholders in the development of conservation initiatives and a more sustainable palm oil industry.},

abstract = {Questions: Functional redundancy in assemblages may insure ecosystem pro- cesses after perturbation, potentially causing temporary or permanent local spe- cies extinctions. Yet, functional redundancy has only been inferred by indirect evidence or measured by methods that may not be the most appropriate. Here, we apply an existing method to measure functional redundancy, which is the fraction of species diversity not expressed by functional diversity, to assess whether functional redundancy affects community resilience after disturbance. Location: Subtropical grassland, south Brazil (30°05′46″S, 51°40′37″W). Method: Species traits and community composition were assessed in quadrats before grazing and after community recovery. Grazing intensity (G)was mea- sured in each quadrat.We used traits linked to grazing intensity to define func- tional redundancy (FR)asthe difference of Gini–Simpson index of species diversity (D) and Rao's quadratic entropy (Q). Also, with the same traits, we defined community functional stability (S) as the similarity between trait-based community composition before grazing and 47 and 180 d after grazing ending. Using path analysis we assessed different postulated causal models linking functional diversity (Q), functional redundancy (FR), grazing intensity (G)and community-weightedmean traits to community stability (S) under grazing. Results: Path analysis revealed themost valid causal model FR ? S G,with a significant positive path coefficient for FR ? S and a marginally significant negative one for S G.Since FR and G were independent in their covariation and in their effects on S, themodel discriminated community resistance to graz- ing (the effect of G on S) from community resilience after grazing caused by functional redundancy (indicated by the effect of FR on S). Conclusion:We showthat expressing functional redundancymathematically is a useful tool for testing causal models linking diversity to community stability. The results support the conclusion that functional redundancy enhanced com- munity resilience, therefore corroborating the insurance hypothesis.},

abstract = {Tropical Southeast Asia harbors extraordinary species richness and in its entirety comprises four of the Earth's 34 biodiversity hotspots. Here, we examine the assembly of the Southeast Asian biota through time and space. We conduct meta-analyses of geological, climatic and biological (including 61 phylogenetic) datasets to test which areas have been the sources of long-term biological diversity in SE Asia, particularly in the pre-Miocene, Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene, and whether the respective biota have been dominated by in situ diversification, immigration and/or emigration, or equilibrium dynamics. We identify Borneo and Indochina, in particular, as major  evolutionary hotspots' for a diverse range of fauna and flora. While most of the region's biodiversity is a result of both the accumulation of immigrants and in situ diversification, within-area diversification and subsequent emigration have been the predominant signals characterizing Indochina and Borneo's biota since at least the early Miocene. In contrast, colonization events are comparatively rare from younger volcanically active emergent islands such as Java, which show increased levels of immigration events. Few dispersal events were observed across the major biogeographic barrier of Wallace's Line. Accelerated efforts to conserve Borneo's flora and fauna in particular, currently housing the highest levels of Southeast Asian plant and mammal species richness, are critically required.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Springer Science+Business Media DordrechtThe ecological resilience of abandoned pastures has important implications for the potential of passive restoration in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, especially in the face of the ambitious restoration targets for this biodiversity hotspot. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the influence of past land-use on natural regeneration in two secondary forests that established on abandoned pastures with different land use histories (Abandoned + Fire—15 years since the last fire event and Abandoned—36 years ago) in a lowland Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Both secondary forests exhibit low resilience for the three analyzed attributes: vegetation structure, richness, and species composition. Secondary forests affected by fire have the lowest values for species richness, aboveground biomass and leaf area index compared to old-growth forests. Secondary forests were dominated by Moquiniastrum polymorphum—Asteraceae, which was absent from the old-growth forests. Fire resistance, capacity to establish in nutrient-poor soils and efficient seed dispersal in human-modified landscapes are important attributes that may explain the dominance of this species. We demonstrate that even in sites considered appropriate for passive restoration a priori (e.g. located in a protected area, 36 years since abandonment and close to old-growth forests), secondary forests exhibited low aboveground biomass and communities were dominated by few species. Therefore, our results highlight the effects of past land-use on natural regeneration and suggest the necessity to use interventions such as enrichment plantings, nucleation techniques and assisted natural regeneration in order to accelerate forest restoration.},

abstract = {Functional diversity is a component of biodiversity that generally concerns the range of things that organisms do in communities and ecosystems. Here, we review how functional diversity can explain and predict the impact of organisms on ecosystems and thereby provide a mechanistic link between the two. Critical points in developing predictive measures of functional diversity are the choice of functional traits with which organisms are distinguished, how the diversity of that trait information is summarized into a measure of functional diversity, and that the measures of functional diversity are validated through quantitative analyses and experimental tests. There is a vast amount of trait information available for plant species and a substantial amount for animals. Choosing which traits to include in a particular measure of functional diversity will depend on the specific aims of a particular study. Quantitative methods for choosing traits and for assigning weighting to traits are being developed, but need much more work before we can be confident about trait choice. The number of ways of measuring functional diversity is growing rapidly. We divide them into four main groups. The first, the number of functional groups or types, has significant problems and researchers are more frequently using measures that do not require species to be grouped. Of these, some measure diversity by summarizing distances between species in trait space, some by estimating the size of the dendrogram required to describe the difference, and some include information about species' abundances. We show some new and important differences between these, as well as what they indicate about the responses of assemblages to loss of individuals. There is good experimental and analytical evidence that functional diversity can provide a link between organisms and ecosystems but greater validation of measures is required. We suggest that non-significant results have a range of alternate explanations that do not necessarily contradict positive effects of functional diversity. Finally, we suggest areas for development of techniques used to measure functional diversity, highlight some exciting questions that are being addressed using ideas about functional diversity, and suggest some directions for novel research.},

abstract = {To clarify the causes and history of forest loss in Indonesia from 1950 to 2015, we compiled and analyzed national-level statistics and literature relating to forest cover change. In 1950, nearly 159.0 Mha (87.0{\%}) of the total land area (182.7 million hectares or Mha) in Indonesia was estimated to be covered by forest. Between 1950 and 1997, 59.0 Mha of forest was deforested, while 7.1 Mha of arable land, 10.2 Mha of permanent crop, and 41.7 Mha of "other" land category were increased. Between 1997 and 2015, 5.6 Mha of arable land and 11.3 Mha of land for permanent crop were increased, while 9.0 Mha of forest and 7.9 Mha of the "other" category decreased. Prior to 1970, no trend of severe forest loss was apparent. Between 1970 and the mid-1990s, export-oriented log production and global demand were the primary pressures underlying deforestation. Cultivation of rice and other crops was also found to be associated with a growing population and transmigration policy. Moreover, deregulation of foreign investment in the 1980s appears to have led to expansion of an export-oriented industry, including commercial crop and log production. Between the mid-1990s and 2015, imbalance between global demand and production of Indonesian timber and oil palm led to illegal or non-sustainable timber harvest and expansion of permanent agricultural areas. Since 2011, regulation of forestry practices coupled with a tree planting movement have been promoted, resulting in the amelioration of deforestation rates.},

Hence, we propose a framework that takes advantage of the multiplicity of components of an ecosystem and their contribution to stability. Ecosystem components can range from species or functional groups, to different functional traits, or even the cover of different habitats in a landscape mosaic. We make use of n-dimensional hypervolumes to define ecosystem states and assess how much they shift after environmental changes have occurred. We demonstrate the value of this framework with a study case on the effects of environmental change on Alpine ecosystems. Our results highlight the importance of a multidimensional approach when studying ecosystem stability and show that our framework is flexible enough to be applied to different types of ecosystem components, which can have impor- tant implications for the study of ecosystem stability and transient dynamics.},

However, observed hypervol-umes (e.g., realized niches) could also have holes, defined as unoccu-pied hyperspace representing deviations from these expectations that may indicate unconsidered ecological or evolutionary processes. De-tecting holes in more than two dimensions has to date not been possi-ble. I develop a mathematical approach, implemented in the hyper-volume R package, to infer holes in large and high-dimensional data sets. As a demonstration analysis, I assess evidence for vacant niches in a Galapagos finch community on Isabela Island. These mathematical concepts and software tools for detecting holes provide approaches for addressing contemporary research questions across ecology and evolu-tionary biology.},

abstract = {Ecosystem resilience depends on functional redundancy (the number of species contributing similarly to an ecosystem function) and response diversity (how functionally similar species respond differently to disturbance). Here, we explore how land-use change impacts these attributes in plant communities, using data from 18 land-use intensity gradients that represent five biomes and {\textgreater} 2800 species. We identify functional groups using multivariate analysis of plant traits which influence ecosystem processes. Functional redundancy is calculated as the species richness within each group, and response diversity as the multivariate within-group dispersion in response trait space, using traits that influence responses to disturbances. Meta-analysis across all datasets showed that land-use intensification significantly reduced both functional redundancy and response diversity, although specific relationships varied considerably among the different land-use gradients. These results indicate that intensified management of ecosystems for resource extraction can increase their vulnerability to future disturbances.},

We used virtual experiments based on a dynamic simulation model to test for the diversity-stability relationship and its underlying mechanisms in Central European forests. First our results show that variability in productivity between stands differing in species composition decreases as species richness and functional diversity increase. Second we show temporal stability increases with increasing diversity due to compensatory dynamics across species, supporting the biodiversity insurance hypothesis. We demonstrate that this pattern is mainly driven by the asynchrony of species responses to small disturbances rather than to environmental fluctuations, and is only weakly affected by the net biodiversity effect on productivity. Furthermore, our results suggest that compensatory dynamics between species may enhance ecosystem stability through an optimisation of canopy occupancy by coexisting species.},

Recent years have seen a broadening in the scope of research, with a slight growth in publications on the environment and a dramatic increase in those on biofuel. Despite this, less than 1{\%} of publications are related to biodiversity and species conservation. In the context of global vegetable oil markets, palm oil and soyabean account for over 60{\%} of production but are the subject of less than 10{\%} of research.

In our original note (Qiao et al., 2016), we explained that KDE (a) is sensitive to both sample size and environmental dimensionality, (b) may overestimate niche volumes in low dimensions and constrict niche volume estimates in high dimensions, and (c) is useful only to the extent that the realized niche is sought and not the fundamental niche. Here, we also note that bandwidth is a crucial parameter for KDE, and its selection needs to be evaluated rigorously and all assumptions stated clearly. In their response to our comments, Blonder et al. (2017) indicated that (a) KDE output depends in useful ways on dataset size and bias, (b) other species distribution modelling methods make equally stringent but different assumptions about dataset bias, (c) we made an incorrect data transformation in our original experiments that may result in unfair comparisons, and (d) hypervolume methods are more general than KDE and have other benefits for niche modelling. We address these points below, which we divide into two main categories: methodological concerns and theoretical concerns.},

abstract = {Oil palm cultivation is expanding rapidly into many of the world's most biodiverse tropical regions. One of the most functionally important and ecologically dominant animal groups in these environments is the ants. Here, we quantify the overall impacts of clear-felling lowland dipterocarp rainforest and conversion into oil palm plantation on ant diversity. At study sites in Sabah, Malaysia we collected ants from three microhabitats: 1 - the canopy, 2 - bird's nest ferns (Asplenium nidus complex, a common epiphyte in forest and oil palm), and 3 - leaf litter. We also measured temperature, humidity and light at collection sites to assess their impacts on ant community composition. Total ant species richness decreased from 309 to 110 (-64{\%}) between forest and oil palm plantation. However, this impact was not the same across all microhabitats, with bird's nest ferns maintaining almost the same number of ant species in oil palm compared to forest (forest-oil palm, ferns: 36-35 (3{\%} loss), canopy: 120-58 (52{\%} loss), leaf litter: 216-56 (74{\%} loss)). Relative abundance distributions remained the same for fern-dwelling ants, but became less even for oil palm ants in both the canopy and the leaf litter. These differences may be due in part to the ability of bird's nest ferns to provide a stable microclimate in hot, dry plantations. We also found that non-native ant species were more abundant in oil palm than in forest, and few forest ant species survived in plantations in any of the microhabitats. Only 59 of the 309 forest species persisted in oil palm plantations, corresponding to an 81{\%} loss of forest species resulting from habitat conversion. Although oil palm supports many more ant species than has been previously reported, converting forest into plantation still leads to a dramatic reduction in species richness. The maintenance of forested areas is therefore vital for the conservation of ant biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r {\"{O}}kologie.},

abstract = {The relationship between species diversity and functional diversity is a fundamental topic in conservation ecology but its direct evaluation in naturally heterogeneous systems and its relationship with disturbance intensity is limited. We examined the relationship between taxonomy-based species diversity (in terms of richness and evenness) and trait-based functional diversity of riparian and upland vegetation and determined if the slopes of this relationship vary with disturbance intensity. We used data from riparian and upland plant communities subjected to three categorical disturbance intensities (low¼uncut mature forests, intermediate¼riparian buffers around clearcuts and riparian buffers around clearcutsþsoil scarification, and high¼clearcuts and clearcutsþsoil scarification) along 24 small streams of boreal forests in northwestern Ontario, Canada. For all disturbance intensities and habitat types (riparian vs. upland), the relationships between species diversity and functional diversity were positive and non-zero, but the slopes of these relationships varied significantly with disturbance intensities. In species richness vs. functional richness relationship, the slopes were steep at low and high disturbances and relatively less steep at moderate disturbance; however, patterns were less clear in species evenness vs. functional evenness relationship. Differential distributions of species richness per trait were, in part, associated with this variation in slope. In richness (opposite for evenness), less steep slopes were associated with relatively uniform distribution of species richness per trait compared to non-uniform distribution at steep slopes, where competitive (low disturbance) and disturbance-tolerant (high disturbance) traits dominated. Our results confirm that species diversity is a good indicator of ecosystem stability but it depends on ecosystem disturbance history. More importantly, this study suggests that different components of species diversity (e.g., richness and evenness) and the distribution of species richness per trait together can summarize the stability of an ecosystem more accurately than prediction made from species diversity alone.},

Oil palm has replaced large areas of forest in Southeast Asia, but land-cover change statistics alone do not allow an assessment of where it has driven forest clearance and where it has simply followed it. Oil palm plantations support much fewer species than do forests and often also fewer than other tree crops. Further negative impacts include habitat fragmentation and pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions. With rising demand for vegetable oils and biofuels, and strong overlap between areas suitable for oil palm and those of most importance for biodiversity, substantial biodiversity losses will only be averted if future oil palm expansion is managed to avoid deforestation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Aim This study focuses on the influence of methodological choices on the predictive performance of macroecological models (MEMs), i.e. statistical models designed to predict patterns of biodiversity using environmental predictors. We emphasize the influence of three methodological choices: (1) the choice of the currency in which the abundance of each species is measured, i.e. numbers of individuals or biomass; (2) the rules used to define the species assemblage under focus, i.e. broad communities or refined ecological guilds; and (3) the influence of rare over common species in the biodiversity measure. Location The effects of these choices are investigated using an exhaustive dataset on the fish fauna of the continental shelf of the Barents Sea. Methods We conducted an analysis of 220 models resulting from all possible combinations of the three methodological choices. For each, we evaluated the predictive performance through an iterative cross-validation process. Results All methodological choices we investigated strongly affected the predictive performance of MEMs. High predictive performances were obtained when using biomass instead of numbers of individuals, when focusing on narrow ecological guilds composed of species sharing the same ecological traits and when using diversity measures that give high weight to rare species. Main conclusions We recommend that future projections of biodiversity pay more attention to abundance currency, ecological homogeneity of focal species assemblages and the diversity metric used, and systematically investigate these methodological choices prior to producing biodiversity forecasts. Splitting a whole set of species into ecological guilds appears to be a promising practice, leading to a selected set of MEMs with high predictive performances and more detailed forecasts on the fate of diversity.},

abstract = {Understanding the ways in which ecological communities are affected by habitat modification is one of the conditions for effective conservation and sustainable land-management. This study used capture-mark-recapture methods to investigate the response of small non-volant mammals to tropical forest logging and conversion to oil palm at a site in Northern Borneo. Trapping grids were established in unlogged primary forest, twice logged forest and oil palm plantations as part of the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems project, a large ecological experiment investigating the effects of disturbance on tropical forest biodiversity. Measures of community structure, composition and species richness were compared between the three habitats. Species-specific densities were estimated and contrasted between the different grids using innovative spatially explicit mark-recapture techniques. Finally, habitat use at the trap-level was further investigated for the three most common species as well as for the genus Rattus by modelling detection as a function of 10 micro-habitat characteristics. A total of 23 different species were caught overall. Grids sampled in logged forest showed higher species richness and similar structure to that of the unlogged forest site. Communities in both these habitats were considerably more diverse and harboured a higher number of specialised species than in the oil palm site, which was largely populated by invasive Rattus species. For two of the three species considered (Maxomys surifer and Maxomys whiteheadi), densities were found to be markedly higher in logged forest, a response partly explained by increased ground vegetation density and a pronounced heterogeneity in micro-habitat patches. Although the design limitations of this study preclude firm conclusions, it appears that logged forests play an important role in maintaining the integrity of small mammal communities and ensuring the persistence of individual species. Recommendations concerning the use of capture-mark-recapture methods to study small mammals in tropical forests are made accordingly.},

Estimating hypervolumes from sampled data has been an ongoing challenge due to conceptual and computational issues. 2. We present new algorithms for delineating the boundaries and probability density within n-dimensional hypervolumes. The methods produce smooth boundaries that can fit data either more loosely (Gaussian kernel density estimation) or more tightly (one-classification via support vector machine). Further, the algorithms can accept abundance-weighted data, and the resulting hypervolumes can be given a probabil- istic interpretation and projected into geographic space. 3. We demonstrate the properties of these methods on a large dataset that character- ises the functional traits and geographic distribution of thousands of plants. The methods are available in version ≥2.0.7 of the HYPERVOLUME R package. 4. These new algorithms provide: (i) a more robust approach for delineating the shape and density of n-dimensional hypervolumes; (ii) more efficient performance on large and high-dimensional datasets; and (iii) improved measures of functional diversity and environmental niche breadth.

To explore this influence, we measured the biomass of microalgae grown in microcosms along two stress gradients, heat and salinity, and compared our results with 13 published case studies that measured biodiversity–ecosystem functioning relationships under varying environmental conditions. We found that positive effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning decreased with increasing stress intensity in absolute terms. However, in relative terms, increasing stress had a stronger negative effect on low-diversity communities. This shows that more diverse biotic communities are functionally less susceptible to environmental stress, emphasises the need to maintain high levels of biodiversity as an insurance against impacts of changing environmental conditions and sets the stage for exploring the mechanisms underlying biodiversity effects in stressed ecosystems.},

abstract = {This paper examines how to obtain species biplots in unconstrained or constrained ordination without resorting to the Euclidean distance [used in principal component analysis (PCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA)] or the chi-square distance [preserved in correspondence analysis (CA) and canonical correspondence analysis (CCA)] which are not always appropriate for the analysis of community composition data. To achieve this goal, transformations are proposed for species data tables. They allow ecologists to use ordination methods such as PCA and RDA, which are Euclidean-based, for the analysis of community data, while circumventing the problems associated with the Euclidean distance, and avoiding CA and CCA which present problems of their own in some cases. This allows the use of the original (transformed) species data in RDA carried out to test for relationships with explanatory variables (i.e. environ- $\backslash$nmental variables, or factors of a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model); ecologists can then draw biplots displaying the relationships of the species to the explanatory variables.

abstract = {Malaria cases caused by Plasmodium knowlesi, a simian parasite naturally found in long-tailed and pig-tailed macaques, are increasing rapidly in Sabah, Malaysia. One hypothesis is that this increase is associated with changes in land use. A study was carried out to identify the anopheline vectors present in different forest types and to observe the human landing behaviour of mosquitoes. Mosquito collections were carried out using human landing catches at ground and canopy levels in the Tawau Division of Sabah. Collections were conducted along an anthropogenic disturbance gradient (primary forest, lightly logged virgin jungle reserve and salvage logged forest) between 18:00 and 22:00 h. $\backslash$n                           Anopheles balabacensis, a vector of P. knowlesi, was the predominant species in all collection areas, accounting for 70 {\%} of the total catch, with a peak landing time of 18:30–20:00 h. Anopheles balabacensis had a preference for landing on humans at ground level compared to the canopy (p {\textless} 0.0001). A greater abundance of mosquitoes were landing in the logged forest compared to the primary forest (p {\textless} 0.0001). There was no difference between mosquito abundance in the logged forest and lightly logged forest (p = 0.554). A higher evening temperature (p {\textless} 0.0001) and rainfall (p {\textless} 0.0001) significantly decreased mosquito abundance during collection nights. This study demonstrates the potential ability of An. balabacensis to transmit P. knowlesi between canopy-dwelling simian hosts and ground-dwelling humans, and that forest disturbance increases the abundance of this disease vector. These results, in combination with regional patterns of land use change, may partly explain the rapid rise in P. knowlesi cases in Sabah. This study provides essential data on anthropophily for the principal vector of P. knowlesi which is important for the planning of vector control strategies.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {14 1. The lowland forest of Borneo is threatened by rapid logging for timber export and clearing for the 15 expansion of timber and oil palm plantations. The combination of these two processes leaves behind 16 landscapes dotted with small, often heavily degraded forest fragments. The biodiversity value of 17 such fragments, which are easily dismissed as worthless, is uncertain. 18 2. We collected 187 taxa of staphylinid beetles across a land-use gradient in Sabah, Malaysia, 19 spanning pristine tropical lowland forest to heavily-degraded forest. Using these data, we identified 20 shifts in alpha-, beta-, and gamma-diversity in response to forest quality and forest area, and applied 21 our findings from continuous expanses of forest to make predictions on hypothetical forest 22 fragments. 23 3. We found that maintaining high forest quality is important for conserving rare taxa (those important 24 for conserving biodiversity per se), and that very small fragments (10 ha) are likely to harbour the 25 same richness of staphylinids as larger fragments (100 ha) of the same forest quality. We estimate a 26 decline in staphylinid richness of just 16{\%} following the removal of 90{\%} of the vegetation biomass 27 from a fragment within this area range. 28 4. Maintaining large forest areas is important for conserving common taxa, likely to be more important 29 for conserving ecosystem functioning. Our analyses suggest that 100 ha fragments of heavily-30 degraded forest can support the same or greater diversity of common taxa as 100 ha fragments of 31 pristine forest. We find that reducing 100 ha fragments to 10 ha fragments will likely result in the loss 32 of just 11{\%} of common taxa diversity. 33 5. Despite significant declines in alpha-diversity, beta-diversity within small rainforest fragments will 34 likely partially mitigate the loss of gamma-diversity, reinforcing the concept that beta-diversity is a 35 dominant force determining the conservation of species in fragmented landscapes. 36 6. Synthesis and applications. In contrast to previous findings on larger animals, our results suggest that even small fragments of degraded forest might be important reservoirs of invertebrate biodiversity in tropical agriculture landscapes. These fragments should be conserved where they occur and form an integral part of management for more sustainable agriculture in tropical landscapes.},

abstract = {Species diversity is thought to stabilize functioning of plant communities. An alternative view is that stability depends more on dynamics of dominant species than on diversity. We compared inter-annual variability (inverse of stability) of aboveground biomass in paired restored and remnant tallgrass prairies at two locations in central Texas, USA. Data from these two locations were used to test the hypothesis that greater richness and evenness in remnant than restored prairies would reduce variability in aboveground biomass in response to natural variation in rainfall. Restored prairies were chosen to be similar to paired remnant prairies in characteristics other than species diversity that affect temporal variability in biomass. Variability was measured as the coefficient of variation among years (square root of variance/mean; CV), where variance in community biomass equals the sum of variances of individual plant species plus the summed covariances between species pairs. Species diversity over five years was greater by a factor of 2 or more in remnant than restored prairies because richness and evenness were greater in remnant than restored prairies. Still, the CV of community biomass during spring and CV of annual biomass production did not differ consistently between prairie types. Neither the sum of species covariances nor total community biomass differed between prairies. Biomass varied relatively little in restored compared to remnant prairies because biomass of the dominant species in restored prairies (the grass Schizachyrium scoparium) varied less than did biomass of other dominant and sub-dominant species. In these grasslands, biomass response to natural variation in precipitation depended as much on characteristics of a dominant grass as on differences in diversity.},

This 3 clearly impacts associated freshwater ecosystems, but the impact on their biodiversity remains 4 largely understudied and poorly understood, despite the important provisioning service that 5 freshwater fishes provide for human well-being. This study quantifies the biomass stocks of 6 freshwater fish across a land use gradient encompassing primary forest, twice-logged forest and oil 7 palm plantations in Sabah, Malaysia, in an area where local communities are known to harvest 8 freshwater fish. Stream fish were sampled using a cast net, the dominant technique used by local 9 fishermen, in 200 m long transects in 16 streams over three sampling years (2011, 2013 and 2015). 10 Unexpectedly, no impact of land use on total fish availability was detected. There were no significant 11 differences in fish species richness, or most importantly, biomass per unit fishing effort across the 12 land use gradient. There was variation in the responses of five known food species (Tor tambra, 13 Hampala sabana, Barbodes sealei, Barbonymus balleroides and Gastromyzon lepidogaster), and 14 these small differences are attributed to variation in species habitat selection that co-vary with land 15 use change. Despite evidence to suggest freshwater fish communities are resilient to land use 16 change, they still face risks associated with disturbance such as invasion by alien species; 17 furthermore, several of the more stenotopic species were only present in primary forest catchments. 18 Nonetheless, freshwater fish in small headwater streams appear to represent a sustainable food 19 resource for villages established in human-modified forests or developed oil palm plantations. 20 21},

abstract = {Increasingly, the success of management interventions aimed at biodiversity conservation are viewed as being dependent on the 'resilience' of the system. Although the term 'resilience' is increasingly used by policy makers and environmental managers, the concept of 'resilience' remains vague, varied and difficult to quantify. Here we clarify what this concept means from an ecological perspective, and how it can be measured and applied to ecosystem management. We argue that thresholds of disturbance are central to measuring resilience. Thresholds are important because they offer a means to quantify how much disturbance an ecosystem can absorb before switching to another state, and so indicate whether intervention might be necessary to promote the recovery of the pre-disturbance state. We distinguish between helpful resilience, where resilience helps recovery, and unhelpful resilience where it does not, signalling the presence of a threshold and the need for intervention. Data to determine thresholds are not always available and so we consider the potential for indices of functional diversity to act as proxy measures of resilience. We also consider the contributions of connectivity and scale to resilience and how to incorporate these factors into management. We argue that linking thresholds to functional diversity indices may improve our ability to predict the resilience of ecosystems to future, potentially novel, disturbances according to their spatial and temporal scales of influence. Throughout, we provide guidance for the application of the resilience concept to ecosystem management. In doing so, we confirm its usefulness for improving biodiversity conservation in our rapidly changing world. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

An understanding of the mechanistic role of biodiversity is required to provide a functional perspective on ecosystem service delivery. To bridge this gap, investigating complementarity and heterogeneity in functional traits within species groups or across trophic levels is particularly relevant. Such an understanding will then facilitate spatial mapping of areas of co-occurrence of multiple ecosystem services, as well as of critical trade-offs between monetized, cultural and other supporting ecosystem services that need to be considered as hard constraints to ecosystem management. In doing so, the nature and underpinnings of tradeoffs between bundles of ecosystem services accruing to different regions and groups of people, impacting equity and wellbeing, will be uncovered to support improved policy and land planning. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We show that farming is already the greatest extinction threat to birds (the best known taxon), and its adverse impacts look set to increase, especially in developing countries. Two competing solutions have been proposed: wildlife-friendly farming (which boosts densities of wild populations on farmland but may decrease agricultural yields) and land sparing (which minimizes demand for farmland by increasing yield). We present a model that identifies how to resolve the trade-off between these approaches. This shows that the best type of farming for species persistence depends on the demand for agricultural products and on how the population densities of different species on farmland change with agricultural yield. Empirical data on such density-yield functions are sparse, but evidence from a range of taxa in developing countries suggests that high-yield farming may allow more species to persist.},

abstract = {The Malaysian oil palm industry is one of the most highly organised sectors of any national agriculture system of the world. Today, though, the focus has shifted to how well agriculture also meets universally accepted standards of sustainability. This paper highlights the development of oil palm cultivation and responsible farming practices in Malaysia, the world's largest producer of palm oil. The oil palm has had a natural head start in fulfilling sustainability indicators due to its plant physiology of high productivity and efficient carbon assimilation. Over the last 50 years, R{\&}D activities and technological advances have helped raise yields and reduce inputs, thereby maximising oil production from a smaller land area than used for other food crops. Palm oil is now a major source of sustainable and renewable raw material for the world's food, oleochemical and biofuel industries. Involvement in cultivation or downstream activities has uplifted the quality of life of people, a key plank of the sustainability platform. In particular, this has helped alleviate poverty among landless farmers in Malaysia. Industry players have recently joined hands with other stakeholders to pursue certification of sustainably produced palm oil with full traceability. Also being explored are measures to conserve forests with high value and the wildlife population.},

Here, we develop a theory that predicts the temporal variability of community biomass from the properties of individual component species in monoculture. Our theory shows that biodiversity stabilises ecosystems through three main mechanisms: (1) asynchrony in species' responses to environmental fluctuations, (2) reduced demographic stochasticity due to overyielding in species mixtures and (3) reduced observation error (including spatial and sampling variability). Parameterised with empirical data from four long-term grassland biodiversity experiments, our prediction explained 22–75{\%} of the observed variability, and captured much of the effect of species richness. Richness stabilised communities mainly by increasing community biomass and reducing the strength of demographic stochasticity. Our approach calls for a re-evaluation of the mechanisms explaining the effects of biodiversity on ecosystem stability.},

abstract = {Human-driven ecosystem simplification has highlighted questions about how the number of species in an ecosystem influences its functioning. Although biodiversity is now known to affect ecosystem productivity, its effects on stability are debated. Here we present a long-term experimental field test of the diversity-stability hypothesis. During a decade of data collection in an experiment that directly controlled the number of perennial prairie species, growing-season climate varied considerably, causing year-to-year variation in abundances of plant species and in ecosystem productivity. We found that greater numbers of plant species led to greater temporal stability of ecosystem annual aboveground plant production. In particular, the decadal temporal stability of the ecosystem, whether measured with intervals of two, five or ten years, was significantly greater at higher plant diversity and tended to increase as plots matured. Ecosystem stability was also positively dependent on root mass, which is a measure of perenniating biomass. Temporal stability of the ecosystem increased with diversity, despite a lower temporal stability of individual species, because of both portfolio (statistical averaging) and overyielding effects. However, we found no evidence of a covariance effect. Our results indicate that the reliable, efficient and sustainable supply of some foods (for example, livestock fodder), biofuels and ecosystem services can be enhanced by the use of biodiversity.},

abstract = {Increasing frequency of extreme climate events is likely to impose increased stress on ecosystems and to jeopardize the services that ecosystems provide. Therefore, it is of major importance to assess the effects of extreme climate events on the temporal stability (i.e., the resistance, the resilience, and the variance) of ecosystem properties. Most time series of ecosystem properties are, however, affected by varying data characteristics, uncertainties, and noise, which complicate the comparison of ecosystem stability metrics (ESMs) between locations. Therefore, there is a strong need for a more comprehensive understanding regarding the reliability of stability metrics and how they can be used to compare ecosystem stability globally. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of temporal ESMs based on time series of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index of 15 global land-cover types. We provide a framework (i) to assess the reliability of ESMs in function of data characteristics, uncertainties and noise and (ii) to integrate reliability estimates in future global ecosystem stability studies against climate disturbances. The performance of our framework was tested through (i) a global ecosystem comparison and (ii) an comparison of ecosystem stability in response to the 2003 drought. The results show the influence of data quality on the accuracy of ecosystem stability. White noise, biased noise, and trends have a stronger effect on the accuracy of stability metrics than the length of the time series, temporal resolution, or amount of missing values. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of integrating reliability estimates to interpret stability metrics within confidence limits. Based on these confidence limits, other studies dealing with specific ecosystem types or locations can be put into context, and a more reliable assessment of ecosystem stability against environmental disturbances can be obtained.},

abstract = {Tropical forests are being continually degraded and converted to plantations, to the detriment of the organisms living within them. Understanding how land use change affects the very processes underpinning ecosystem function is understudied, yet plays a key role in biodiversity conservation. This study used exclosure experiments to quantify the roles played by vertebrates and invertebrates in secondary seed removal, at a site in Northern Borneo. Transects were laid out in unlogged primary forest, twice logged secondary forest and oil palm plantation, all as part of the Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems project, a large ecological project examining the effects of fragmentation and conversion to monocultural agriculture on forests in Malaysia. The relationship between rates of seed removal and forest quality were investigated. Invertebrates were found to dominate seed removal across all habitats and forest quality levels, with significantly increased vertebrate seed removal in highly degraded forest, which is thought to be linked to higher ground vegetation in these microhabitats. Although seed size and chemistry must play an important role, it appears that invertebrates play a key role in secondary seed predation and dispersal beyond what was assumed for South-East Asian forests.},

abstract = {The composition of species communities is changing rapidly through drivers such as habitat loss and climate change, with potentially serious consequences for the resilience of ecosystem functions on which humans depend. To assess such changes in resilience, we analyse trends in the frequency of species in Great Britain that provide key ecosystem functions-specifically decomposition, carbon sequestration, pollination, pest control and cultural values. For 4,424 species over four decades, there have been significant net declines among animal species that provide pollination, pest control and cultural values. Groups providing decomposition and carbon sequestration remain relatively stable, as fewer species are in decline and these are offset by large numbers of new arrivals into Great Britain. While there is general concern about degradation of a wide range of ecosystem functions, our results suggest actions should focus on particular functions for which there is evidence of substantial erosion of their resilience.},

abstract = {Evolutionary hypotheses about how so many species of tropical rainforest trees might have arisen include (a) genetic drift (71), (b) habitat specialization (8) in benign environments, or (c) repeated geographic isolation followed by remixing of species during Pleistocene climatic fluctuations (144). Ecological hypotheses about how these species continue to coexist are often cast into equilibrium or non-equilibrium frameworks: Do tropical forests comprise " . . . sets of highly coevolved niche-differentiated tree species in stable or semi- stable floristic assemblages," or do they consist of " . . . diffusely coevolved, broadly generalist species which slowly drift in relative abundance within a few large life-history guilds" (67, 102)? In this context, there has been considerable recent interest in the role of adaptations by species to different regeneration sites in structuring plant assemblages in general (83, 84, 86, 141), and tropical tree communities in particular (62, 89, 90, 150). The immediacy of this interest is heightened by rising rates of deforestation throughout the tropics and a critical need for management strategies of the remaining preserves, for ecologically sound harvesting procedures, and for the tools with which to restore degraded forests. Openings in the forest canopy are widely recognized as important for the establishment and growth of rainforest trees (5, 33, 62, 90). Hartshorn (89) suggests that perhaps 75{\%} of the tree species at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica are dependent on canopy opening for seed germination or for growth beyond sapling size. Similar statements are found in descriptions of forest dynamics in Queensland, Australia (185), Malaysian dipterocarp for- ests (195), and West African rain forest (108). Demographic},

However, species richness determines ecosystem functioning through the diversity and values of traits of species present. Here, we analyze changes in species richness and functional diversity (FD) at varying agricultural land use intensity levels. We test hypotheses of FD responses to land use intensification in plant, bird, and mammal communities using trait data compiled for 1600+ species. To isolate changes in FD from changes in species richness we compare the FD of communities to the null expectations of FD values. In over one-quarter of the bird and mammal communities impacted by agriculture, declines in FD were steeper than predicted by species number. In plant communities, changes in FD were indistinguishable from changes in species richness. Land use intensification can reduce the functional diversity of animal communities beyond changes in species richness alone, potentially imperiling provisioning of ecosystem services.},

As a result, our KDE method remains a promising tool for species distribution modelling.},

abstract = {Three markedly different models of multispecies competition- one mechanistic, one phenomenological, and one statistical- all predict that greater diversity increases the temporal stability of the entire community, decreases the temporal stability of individual populations, and increases community productivity. We define temporal stability as the ratio of mean abundance to its standard deviation. Interestingly, the temporal stability of entire communities is predicted to increase fairly linearly, without clear saturation, as diversity increases. Species composition is predicted to be as important as diversity in affecting community stability and productivity. The greater temporal stability of more diverse communities is causedby higher productivity at higher diversity (the "overyielding" effect), competitive interactions (the "covariance" effect), and statistical averaging (the "portfolio" effect). The relative contribution of each cause of temporal stability changes as diversity increases, but the net effect is that greater diversity stabilizes the community even though it destabilizes individual populations. This theory agrees with recent experiments and provides a degree of resolution to the diversitystabilitydebate: both sides of the longstanding debate were correct, but one addressed population stability and the other addressed community stability},

abstract = {Summary Despite extensive development of successional theory, few empirical studies have evaluated whether existing models are applicable to human-modified landscapes. Seasonally dry tropical forests are experiencing widespread transformation, and represent a critical system to assess in a successional framework to infer the mechanisms that shape assembly of secondary forests post-management. We used a functional trait-based approach to assess changes in community assembly mechanisms along a successional gradient in secondary dry forests of varying stages following abandonment of cattle activity. Nearby old-growth forests served as an undisturbed comparison. We evaluated whether re-assembly proceeded consistent with existing theory, in early successional stages via habitat filtering, leading to reduced trait range, and via competitive exclusion in later stages, leading to increased trait evenness. Using three orthogonal traits and two functional diversity indices we tested for evidence of assembly mechanisms along resource axes that may be particularly important to dry forest systems, dynamic changes in habitat filtering and competitive exclusion, and potential legacy effects of management. We found little support of a progression from habitat filtering to competitive exclusion, with the exception of dispersion patterns for specific leaf area and multi-variate functional richness. Water availability may underlie species sorting in most stages, as evidenced by range reduction in wood density, and might be a resource particularly important to dry forest assembly. Early successional stages displayed an unexpected pattern of low evenness, which may be due to initial stand composition including remnants and resprouts, a regeneration strategy typical to dry forest species. Beyond influencing initial conditions, management legacy was apparent in advanced secondary forests, which differed in range, even dispersion, and functional richness from old-growth forests, suggesting the operation of different assembly mechanisms. The departures from expectations suggest the need to re-assess successional models to include effects of management legacies on the operation of community assembly mechanisms in human-modified landscapes, as well as characteristics that distinguish wet and dry forest dynamics.},
