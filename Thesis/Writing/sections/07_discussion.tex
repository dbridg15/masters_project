Para1 - Brief description of results.

Para2 - yay I found a significant result - trees are more stable than beetles or mammals (who would've thought!)

Para3 - no significance on AGB! - Why might that be?

Para4 - in general hypervolumes performed pretty badly in these circumstances - potential reasons (compare with other measures of stability...)

Para5 - more on the general limitations of the study

Para6 - don't give up hope there is still plenty of scope for hypervolumes in the future! - Just imagine if I had had functional data!


Conclusions...
