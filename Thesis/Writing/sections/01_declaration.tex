\subsection*{Data Used}

All data from this thesis was provided by projects based at SAFE, a large-scale forest fragmentation experiment \citep{Ewers2011}. Data on trees came from Terhi Riutta \citep{Riutta2018}, small-mammals from Philip Chapman \citep{Chapman2018} and beetles from Adam Sharp (\url{https://www.safeproject.net/datasets/view_dataset?id=123}).

\subsection*{Analysis}

All code and analysis was undertaken by myself with the use of Python and R \citep{RCoreTeam2017}. The R package 'hypervolumes' \citep{Blonder2017a} was utilised in the construction of hypervolumes. All code is available at \url{https://github.com/dbridg15/masters_project}.

\subsection*{Supervision}

Prof. Rob Ewers and Dr. David Orme provided regular input on my analysis, suggesting possible methods and extensions.
