\section{Introduction}

Ecosystems worldwide are experiencing escalating pressures from human influenced environmental changes including land-use and climate change \citep{Hautier2015}. Conversion of natural landscapes to agriculture and urban environments has been driven by continued population growth and increased demand for resources \citep{Green2005, Foley2005} having significant impacts on global biodiversity \citep{Pimm1995}. These changes are shifting ecosystem communities away from historically stable states \citep{Hautier2015} and impacting their resilience to future environmental perturbations \citep{Oliver2015}. These losses in biodiversity lead to loss of ecosystem function and services on which we rely \citep{Diaz2006, MillenniumEcosystemAssessment2005}.The impacts of these environmental changes are hard to predict \citep{Carpenter2009}, though globally ecosystem services are deteriorating \citep{Mace2012}.

Land-use changes are particularly prevalent in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia – a global biodiversity hotspot \citep{DeBruyn2014},  where selective logging for timber and conversion to oil palm plantations has significantly changed the structure of the rainforests which support such a high diversity \citep{Gibson2011}. This logging has left degraded forest, fragments of old growth and palm-oil plantations, all of which support a much lower species diversity than the continuous forests they replace \citep{Fitzherbert2008, Haddad2015} . These practices have been essential for the economic development of the region \citep{Basiron2007} but their impact has been significant on ecosystem processes \citep{Koh2011, Schleuning2011, Ewers2015}.  With demand for palm-oil continuing to grow it is essential we learn to better manage these landscapes to mitigate any further impact \citep{Turner2008}.

\subsection{Ecosystem stability}

When referred to in the context of ecosystems stability can have a multitude of meanings \citep{Pimm1984}. It can be measured as: resilience; the time for the ecosystem to return to its equilibrium after a perturbation, resistance; the amount an ecosystem in changed by a perturbation, persistence; the time it takes before an ecosystem responds to the perturbation and variance; the degree to which an ecosystem varies though time. It is also possible to think of stability in terms of the number of possible stable states of a community, with more potential stable states resulting in a less stable system \citep{Scheffer2001}. On top of this stability can be measured at a range of levels of complexity (e.g. species richness or community structure) which further multiplies the possible meaning of ‘stability’ \citep{Pimm1984,Lehman2000}.  It is therefore essential for studies to be explicit in what they are measuring and at which level of complexity as it is likely any relationships will differ between them. Temporal stability \citep{Tilman1999} is a measure of stability based on variance, it is defined as the mean abundance (\mu) of the species divided by the standard deviation (\sigma) of the variation in abundance through time $ \text{S = \mu/\sigma} $. This can be modified to assess the stability of a whole community (equation \ref{equ:temporal_stability}) \citep{Lehman2000}. This equation takes into account the variance of the system as well as how each possible pair of species covary together. From this we can see that the stability of a community increases with higher abundance and reduced variance and covariance. This equation can also be used to look at stability through space in place of time.

\begin{equation} \label{equ:temporal_stability}
\text{S\textsubscript{T}} = \frac{\text{\mu\textsubscript{T}}}{\text{\sigma\textsubscript{T}}} = \frac{\text{\Sigma \, Abundance}}{\sqrt{\text{\Sigma \, Variance + \Sigma \, Covariance}}}
\end{equation}

The relationship between ecosystem stability and biodiversity has been argued over in ecology for decades. Initial thoughts from \cite{Elton1958} and \cite{MacArthur1955} suggested that increasing biodiversity and complexity within a system would directly lead to higher stability. This seems intuitive as with greater species richness there is redundancy for species to fill function when others are lost, known as the insurance hypothesis \citep{Yachi1999}. However further theoretical work contradicted these ideas \citep{May1973} finding that increased diversity and community interactions decreased the stability of a system. Empirical studies have found that there is a positive relationship between diversity and temporal stability \citep{Tilman1994, Tilman2006}, with a systematic review by \cite{Ives2007} showing that a positive relationship was found in 69\% of studies on the topic. A number of explanations as to why diversity may increase stability have been proposed \citep{McCann2000}. \cite{Doak1998} suggested the Averaging effect, showing that even excluding interactions increasing species numbers on average reduced the variation in biomass due to statistical averaging, while \cite{Tilman1998} countered this with the Negative-Covariance effect which suggests that where species have a negative covariance, perhaps due to interspecific competition, this would generally stabilise the community. Regardless, it is clear that there is no simple link between stability and diversity \citep{Goodman1975}.


\begin{itemize}
	\item Different kinds of perturbation shock and press \citep{Ives2007}
	\item Should really study stability comprehensively – not just in terms of diversity (but in the context of other environmental change) \hl{(CITATION)}. 
	\item Key species probably play a role \hl{(CITATION)}. 
	\item \cite{DeMazancourt2013} paper (New ideas about how biodiversity stabilises ecosystems!). Came up with a theoretical model – paramitised from empirical experiments which explains how biodiversity stabilises ecosystems though 3 mechanisms. (explains 22-75\% of observed variation) 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item asynchrony in species’ responses to environmental fluctuations
		\item Overyielding leading to reduced demographic stochasticity 
		\item less errors in observations
	\end{itemize}
	\item \cite{Morin2014} paper
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Used a simulation model to test the diversity-stability relationship and its mechanisms in Central European forests. 
			\item Increased species richness and functional diversity increased the predictability of forest productivity. 
		\end{itemize}
	\item diversity may destabilise individual species dynamics by increasing competitive interactions, while reducing the variability in biomass production of the whole community, thus increasing temporal stability at the ecosystem level \citep{Tilman2006, Proulx2010}.
	\item talk about succession!
\end{itemize}




\subsection{The \emph{n}-dimensional hypervolume}

\cite{Hutchinson1957} introduced the concept of n-dimensional hypervolumes to ecology, using them to evaluate species niches. In his description each axis represents some independent environmental variable, physical or biological, with the hypervolume delineating the ‘Euclidean space’ which represents the environmental conditions which would allow the species to perpetuate. Since then the concept has been extended to incorporate axis of different kinds (climate, morphological traits, functional traits, etc.) measured at varying levels (communities, populations, species) to delineate hypervolumes in n-dimensional space. Allowing questions about niche shifts \citep{Tingley2014, Blonder2015, Jackson2000, Evans2009}, functional richness \citep{Lamanna2014} and clade diversification \citep{Sidlauskas2008} to be explored. And with recent developments allowing hypervolumes to be better delineated, especially in higher dimensions \citep{Blonder2014, Blonder2017b, Junker2016} there is potential for hypervolumes to become a common tool within ecology.

 
\cite{Barros2016} demonstrated that it is possible to describe an ecosystem state as an n-dimensional cloud using axis from a range of ecosystem components, and assess the stability of the ecosystem by comparing the state and trajectory of those hypervolumes following a disturbance. They simulated climate change on European alpine plant communities and constructed two sets of hypervolumes, one from plant functional groups (using abundances as axis - after a PCA to reduce dimensionality) and the other using traits as the axis. They then used measures of hypervolume overlap and centroid change to assess how the simulated ecosystem responded to the perturbation of climate change. This study demonstrated how \emph{n}-dimensional hypervolumes can be used to study stability in a holistic way, taking into account all aspects of an ecosystem.


\subsection{Aims}

In this study I will use n-dimensional hypervolumes, constructed to represent the community composition of trees, mammals and beetles at forest plots from SAFE of different quality (measured by aboveground biomass \hl{(CITATION!?)}. (Should I mention I'll look at overlap?!). Using this I will test the idea that ecosystems with greater biomass will be more stable \hl{(CITATION!?)}, and will also investigate whether longer lived taxa also represent more stable communities, in this case with the expectation that trees will be more stable than mammals which will be more stable than beetle communities. I will also look at how measures of stability using hypervolumes compare to the more established community-temporal-stability \hl{(CITATION!?)} (measured spatially though!).
